well good afternoon to
all the participants who have joined the
through 78th course learning program of
iirs
i welcome all of you to this special
course
organized on geospatial technology
for archaeological and cultural heritage
studies
earlier we had this planned discourse
for about two weeks
and had planned to conduct
very detailed lectures and also some
demonstrations
related to archaeological studies
and cultural heritage studies uh
monitoring and management
documentation of heritage built heritage
especially
through geospatial technology however
due to the prevailing situation that we
have at our end
and all over the country and the world
related to the pandemic
all of us are facing a very difficult
situation
and due to that we had to compress the
course to one week
we shall try our best to convey all the
technology the methods and the case
examples
in this one week in a compressed format
i welcome you all once again i'm happy
to announce that we have about 9000
participants from about eight
more than 800 850 plus institutes that
have
been able to join us i hope you have a
very fruitful learning experience in
this one week
with this i will begin the first lecture
which is the introductory lecture
on geospatial technology for cultural
heritage
use and archaeological studies we will
have an overview of
the technologies that are available also
we i will take you through
the basics of all the technologies what
their advantages are
what how they help us to
go about mapping monitoring documenting
heritage structures
and how it helps us in archaeological
studies
and then i will take you through the
case examples of each of them some of
them
from the international and national uh
researchers and some of them are
the studies that have been done at iirs
so with this i will start
the lecture
so as i said i'll tell you about
heritage
what heritage is and its importance
the earth observation and geospatial
techniques that are available to us in
the current scenario
how these techniques and methods are
useful
for archaeological applications
together with their advantages we will
also highlight the limitations
and how we can use an integrated
approach you can club
different technologies different data
from different sensors
and also club different types of image
processing and gis techniques to
come up with a very comprehensive
documentation plan
and also a plan for
mapping monitoring and management of
these
heritage sites in the current
course that we have planned we will only
be taking you
through methods and techniques for
cultural heritage there are also the
same technology can also be used for
natural heritage
however right now we don't we are not
highlighting any examples of the natural
heritage
studies right and
so as we can say that heritage can be
seen
as a bridge or arch between what we
inherit from our ancestors through time
and what it is that we will leave behind
for the future generations
so it is an arch or a bridge and a very
important bridge that we pass on from
generation to generation
the importance of the cultural and
natural heritage documentation
is very well recognized at the
international level
and there is an increasing pressure on
all the scientific community and the
archaeological
scientists and the historians to
document and preserve
heritage as well as possible and
currently to use the digital methods
available to us
the precise documentation of cultural
heritage status
is now essential for its protection and
scientific studies
that are carried out during the
restoration and the renovation processes
now to summarize the heritage types
types of heritage could be
basically classified into cultural
property
or you know something which is physical
physical or tangible cultural heritage
like monuments
temples forts all these kind of built
heritage structures or even written
manuscripts that you have paintings and
so on
so these would be property something
which is physical and can be seen and
held
the next category would be intangible
culture
so these are non-physical aspects of the
culture
our heritage for example it could be
folklore
four dances songs so on and so forth
some some
customs that are passed on and so on and
so forth so these are non-physical
aspects
intangible cultural heritage this is
also this also forms a very important
part of the
heritage that we sold that is
term the term that is heritage or
culture then comes natural heritage
which refers to diversity that is
available
so you know you like your the value of
flowers in
uttarakhand so it's a biodiversity uh
heritage or geo biodiversity like the
yellowstone national park in the united
states and several other
the uluru rock in australia and so on
and so forth there are several such
natural
heritage the road bridges in the
northeast so there are several such
examples of natural heritage
which geospatial technology
can play a very important role in
documentation
and management and monitoring of such
natural heritage features as well
currently as i said in this one week
program we will only be focusing on the
first
type that is the physical or built
heritage to be
very precise uh we are going to be
taking up heritage sites as
monuments etc and how to document them
manage them and monitor them how to
assess damage that may have happened and
then
for reconstruction etc what steps may be
taken
for protection of the monuments how we
can use
earth observation data how we can club
uh satellite data observation data with
say aerial data or uav data augment
that with uh ground-based data
collection like from terrestrial laser
scanner
or ground-based photographs
these days even crowd-sourced data forms
a very very important part
of a data collection process and
we get very valuable information from
the crowd source data
heritage structures heritage monuments
etc can be reconstructed
using uh data from crowd sourced
examples similarly there are
say several kinds of remotely sensed
data like
laser data uh microwave data and so on
and so forth so we can club the i will
show you examples and also in the
forthcoming lectures you will see
examples that will help you to
see how this integrated approach gives
us a very
detailed set
parameters to document the cultural
heritage
so the rapid advancement in new
technologies has
you know made available this practice of
recording heritage sites and monuments
and it has made it easier
digital tools and media also offer new
or sophisticated means for the user to
be able to collect
analyze and disseminate this information
about heritage sites
when i say heritage science i am
specifically referring to built
heritage structures
new technologies and a growing need to
document
and preserve information and objects
related to cultural heritage
is also expanding at a very rapid rate
so people have realized that these
advanced technologies can help us
and augment our process of documentation
and the preservation for that can be
used for reconstruction
later so 3d recording
we can also collect not information not
just in two dimensions
but as we will discuss later by using
means of photogrammetric
data collection we can do a three
dimensional recording
consequently documentation and
management of the cultural heritage
and this provides the necessary details
and information for constructing
heritage inventories
these inventories can be used for
assessing damage
risk management and the overall
management and monitoring of the
heritage assets
now earth observation we will begin with
earth observation from the satellite
platform
and how we can use geospatial techniques
like
uh image processing
methods of gis deep learning and so on
and so forth
to extract maximum information about the
heritage
structures and put them in a
virtual heritage management system
so earth observation as you know can be
applied to the study of cultural and
natural heritage
and also archaeological studies this
would include documentation
site management and monitoring damage
detection
change detection so if i have
satellite data for a considerable period
of time
say from say the 1970s till
date i can see how the area around the
heritage structure has changed
what anthropological aspects have
affected it
how it has changed over time and what
are its
imprints on the landscape so these
things can be studied
also we can study not just the features
or manifestations that we see on the
surface
but with techniques like microwave data
or ground penetrating radar we can also
have a
idea or have information about the sub
surface features so
varied information for
possible excavation etc or buried
ancient varied cities or sites or
artifacts etc can be
excavated with the help of such
techniques
in this week we have also tried to
incorporate
the basics of such technology for you
now this technique provides extremely
useful information for researchers
decision makers and planners and also
for the
very common man like you and me so that
we are able to see and appreciate
and visualize this heritage uh it
becomes especially important in
times such as these that we are going
through where going out to
a museum or to a site becomes very very
difficult
such techniques will help us to make
virtual museums
and people can make use of those
researchers can make use of such
facilities and study and appreciate
the heritage aspects that we have
through such means so earth observation
as we know
encompasses different types of sensors
which could include
microwave sensors or laser sensors could
be optical
sensors operating in the optical
wavelength
this would be multi-spectral sensors
that is
sensors which give us data in multiple
regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum they could also be
hyperspectral sensors that is
which very high spectral resolution
narrowband wavelength
and uh especially useful for studying
features which are
which can be deciphered only in a very
small narrow continuous band
we could have varying platforms as well
for example
we could study get data through
satellite based platforms
air aerial data aerial photographs
or uavs unmanned aerial vehicles
with these we could do either two
dimensional studies
or if we are applying um
using techniques like sar or lidar
or photogrammetry then we could also
generate three dimensional views and
club them with
other ancillary data like the image
interpreted data
classified data and so on and come up
with a comprehensive
documentation of the entire heritage
site
it could also be augmented information
extraction
is augmented and aided by
use of image processing methods and then
it can be incorporated into an
information system like the gis
so we could call it call it a heritage
information system
now these kind of intelligent systems uh
will
enable monitoring and modeling of
heritage structures
over different regions at different
scales and in which ground observations
may not be possible due to physical or
political constraints
so as i said in any such situation where
we are actually not able to get
uh go physically due to any constraint
like
um regions like syria or war-torn
afghanistan and so on and so forth
uh where people are not able to go but
there are considerable heritage
structures
so earth observation data from a space
based platform
helps us to get an idea and do mapping
and
you know to monitor such heritage sites
without actually having to or to with
minimum
groundwork such structures can be
monitored and modeled and monitored
the other big advantage of earth
observation data
is that it provides high spatial
temporal and spectral resolution data
so i can get very high spatial
resolution data which will help me to
see
the features at different levels of
detail
i also get temporarily varying data that
is at different time periods so that
we are able to
monitor it at different times
so and do a change detection kind of
study
spectral resolution as i said especially
with hyper spectral data
if there is a feature which is
present only in a very narrow region of
the spectrum
then we will be able to use this high
spectral resolution data
and interpret those kind of or similarly
reflecting features
one will be able to make a very detailed
mapping of that area
stereo mapping or three-dimensional
mapping
is also possible with
photogrammetric processing
and sensors like the sar or microwave
sensors are all weather imaging have all
weather capabilities
uh we can do day and night imaging since
they are active sensors they
also have penetrating capabilities so
cloud
etc will not smoke fog etcetera will not
matter so much
and these give us an all-round ability
to be able to
club and complement information from
all of these sources together and come
up with a very comprehensive and
detailed
methodology to map and monitor
these heritage sites also
improved satellite and sensor
technologies with
increased frequency of satellite
measurements that is increased temporal
resolution
and easier access these data are now
easily accessible
and interpretation of the eo data have
all contributed
immensely to the increased demand for
satellite
eu data for these kind of studies
so earth observation data combined with
complementary
data sets from say terrestrial
observation and with physical models
or as i said from crowd sourced data
these have been now widely used for
heritage and archaeological studies
revolutionizing the methods of
management monitoring and
documentation so with the examples that
i
will present before you you will see how
these have become very very
useful in such studies
so just to do a recap of all the
advantages that geospatial technology
offers
for archaeological studies
the first one being that it can
efficiently survey
large areas of land and pinpoint the
most promising locations for
the conventional examination so because
one is able to see it it gives us a
synoptic
view right and this offers clues
that cannot be perceived from the ground
so if you
see if on the ground when we go and do
physical examination
our field of view becomes very limited
and we are not able to
see things in relation or context to
each other
which forms a very very important part
of
archaeological uh interpretation or
heritage
management but earth observation data
offers us a synoptic view and enables us
to see
large areas of land and therefore we are
also able to see
not just the monument or the area that
we of interest
but also other features in its vicinity
and what relationship they may have
with the monument for example if you
look at taj mahal
if you take a satellite image of the
area
and get a vertical view of that
place you will see that it is surrounded
by several
industries now if you locate those
industries in relation to the monument
and if you also add information like
wind direction etc we will be able to
you know come up with a plan of how
these the pollutants from the industry
may be
you know maligning the uh marble etc
and what the effect is on the monument
so these kind of studies can be done
very easily the synoptic view
of earth observation data is an
advantage in this thing advanced remote
sensing technologies allow
landscapes to be viewed so the entire
landscape can be viewed
in light which is invisible to
humans that is humans are sensitive to
seeing
only through the visible portion that is
the vibro
only these wavelengths 0.4 to 0.7
micrometer
wavelength region human beings are
sensitive only to this region that is
the visible portion of the spectrum
we are not able to see through the other
wavelengths that is the shorter
wavelengths like the ultraviolet
or the longer wavelengths like infrared
and even longer ones like microwave
so these wavelength regions also offer
very critical information about
certain features which the remote
sensors
are able to give us otherwise as human
beings through our eyes
we will not be able to perceive this
therefore
we a new light is shed upon
these features and this permits
investigators
to discover features that are too
obscure
maybe under soil or vegetation cover and
they cannot be otherwise
detected so these kind of features will
be
seen by the infrared sensors or the
microwave sensors or the laser sensors
laser sensors will give us a three
dimensional view it can penetrate
through vegetation cover so can
microwave sensors and so on
and this will give us additional
information which otherwise through
visible
or optical region of the spectrum
through human eyes we would not have
been able to perceive
this is an added advantage now remote
sensing can also be used to construct 3d
models of the terrain as i said earlier
through photogrammetric technique and by
taking two images of the same area
thereby this allows investigators to
search for clues among the topographical
features
so if there are mounds we may see
we may investigate that what could be
under the mound
also the pattern of vegetation or the
pattern of soil
how there is an anomaly from the normal
if that can be studied
then what we can do is that the
detecting the
unknown and seeing the context so we can
look at what we is not visible to
the apparent apparently discipline and
then we can also see the context
and do a very enhanced interpretation
and go for investigation or examination
in detail of the
site in question
so as i said the natural and cultural
heritage is the common wealth of human
beings
and it is very important in
understanding of the evolution of the
planet
and for social development the
protection
and conservation of these natural and
cultural heritage
is our common responsibility
it's the common responsibility of all
mankind and therefore it becomes very
very important
spatial information technology provides
a tool
for the protection and utilization of
these
natural and cultural heritage features
how that it will efficiently and
accurately record complex structures
remotely so it is not going to invade
into that structure right it is
non-invasive
digital information systems are evolving
for the presentation that is
visualization
and archival of heritage documentation
also production of multi-purpose nd
models
like 3d models it can be if i add
different dimensions like time etc so it
becomes an nd model
and these can be used for more than just
visualization so we can use them for
visualization
and also for uh you know higher terms of
analysis and
archival of the the heritage now
integration of the 3d model into a 3d
gis
for further management and analysis is
also
enabled through these systems so
potential users here could be
you know right from planners like the
archaeological survey of india
or the department of culture and tourism
to open planners
to researchers students of history and
archaeology and so on and so forth and
even common people
who wish to analyze the
common heritage and that we have
so the overall methodology would be
that you acquire data through any of
suitable means
or you can even club or complement multi
data from multiple sources
and it is analyzed in a heritage
information modeling system
and then 3d gis analysis can be done to
come up with
a heritage information system
so reconstruction entire reconstructions
can be
enabled and the heritage structures can
be
modeled using these techniques
now i'll quickly take you through the
historical aspect
of how this has progressed the
geospatial technology for archaeological
applications
so in the early 90s that is 93 to 95 say
roughly
the arrival of the gps for civilian use
made it very useful we were able to now
take precise coordinates and assign
coordinates to our
mapping work then in the second half of
the 90s
digital photography was introduced into
the global market
and here aerial prospection you know
simplified the photography process both
on both the aircraft and also after
flights
so uh immediate image processing and
large scale digital applicability became
possible then in the late 90s
the launch of the first high resolution
satellite system for civilian use that
is the iconos
produced images of very high spatial
resolution
both in biochromatic and multispectral
domain this became extremely important
for regions where there was a prevalence
of small features for example wherever
there were small
pits or small sunken huts at buried
prehistoric and early medieval
settlements so this could be
earlier when sub meter level satellite
data was not available
the only uh course left was either
fly or an aircraft over it
right so that was not always possible so
with the launch of this
high resolution earth observation system
these kind of studies became very
easily achievable
then in the mid 2000s free access via
google earth
to continuous global ortho photo
coverage was uh
was an advantage that opened up new
aspects for researchers so you could
look at high resolution data
via a free access portal and this gave
us
immense amount of data which could be
used for such
studies uh the next phase from
the mid 2000s from 2005 to 2010
approximately
saw the beginning of the application of
airborne laser scanning this was also a
watershed
marking the in the study of
archaeological features etc
perhaps it was the most revolutionary
aspect post the second world war impact
on
effective detection and mapping of
archaeological landscape heritage
because it is fast very quick precise
and it gives us three dimensional
information and it also gives us digital
information
so a three-dimensional digital
information
which is available to us as very precise
and
quickly acquired data
so this was very very useful for uh
archaeological studies as well apart
from being very useful in other
application areas so especially for
you know areas like the heritage site in
which are covered under vegetation uh
which could not be studied via
optical remote sensing uh the aerial
laser
sensors made this uh
possible for example the
ancient site of angkor wat so this
was hugely vegetation covered and was
uh the aspects of this heritage site
were not known
the area laser scanning you know brought
forth all the the
very varied uh aspects of the
heritage site through the laser scanning
sensors
then the late 2000 onwards the period
saw
intensified application of image
spectrometer
that is using air and spaceborne sensors
hyperspectral data and experimentation
with
automated object detection from remotely
sensed imagery
so now advanced data sets like
hyperspectral data
and people started experimenting with
automated systems like deep learning
machine learning etc for automating the
classification process or future
extraction of
archaeological origin using remotely
sensed
imagery
now the next section we will see how
different kinds of data
are required and how these will be
useful to us in which
application areas for in the area of
archaeological or heritage studies these
can be
used uh so remote
sensing sensors could be space based
they could be aerial sensors aircrafts
or uavs
and they could be terrestrial sensors
these continually provide us with data
sets
with different spatial and spectral
characteristics
then we need to do a series of pre and
post processing techniques
for the calibration purpose also
big data cloud platforms uh will allow
us to deal with an
extensive number of data sets uh please
remember that when we use data sets like
sar data or laser data and combine it
with images or terrestrial laser
scanning data
it becomes huge amount of data and then
big data processing techniques will have
to be
applied to these data sets even crowd
source data if it is
in huge volumes then we will need to be
using
such big data processing techniques so
as you can see
space bond remote sensing could be
active or passive
so it could be through the microwave
sensors
or the optical sensors or the infrared
sensors we also have airborne
remote sensing through platforms such as
balloons
aircrafts or uavs
and ground remote sensing like
mounting it on
certain platforms we can use
laser scanners terrestrial laser
scanners
cameras in fact we have done some
studies using
the cameras on the mobile phones
and have been able to generate stereo
pairs with those and have
of heritage structures as well as urban
structures and we have seen that for
certain applications especially like
if you need quick data near real time
data
and for visualization these form a very
good
uh means of
collecting data and the 3d models that
are
generated probably my colleagues will
show them to you in the coming lectures
are of a quality which is
suitable for such applications
so with this let us see a few examples
of how these data sets can be used for
heritage mapping and monitoring now once
the corona images were
declassified so these were spy images in
taken by the united states in the 1960s
and 70s and well into the 80s
these have now been declassified their
high resolution pantramatic images
and also aerial photographs
so the first one is an aerial photograph
in the
from 1945 now this is the walled city
of bleaching so through historical
photographs
people have mapped the area
of the ancient world beijing old city
so here you will see that
there were certain features that have
been mapped
right the circles indicate the location
of
the z main gate the yellow ellipses show
the extension of the
avenue and the pink and blue boxes
indicate the landscape transformation so
if we are able to take a look at these
the features over time you see that the
landscape
has changed so much so much built up
area has come up
many many changes have happened but
how these features have evolved and how
they have left an
imprint on the landscape surrounding
them this is the map
of the through the time series
so in 1945 then in 1967
some changes have happened and this is
2018
so google earth imagery and this is the
map the layout of the beijing old city
then here is an example of utilizing
medium resolution pan chromatic images
this is satellite data a study done by
dr mb rajani and her associates
so you will see this
we will see this uh through
this is the nalanda mahabhijar they have
studied
and they have also marked out paleo
channels and
here is the heritage area so the
excavated site of nalanda and the
environment
along with the 10 kilometer long paleo
channel
that drew water from the river panchana
to
the site and this is seen in the
cartosat
imagery of 2008.
another very detailed map has been
prepared here
so to show you the spread of the
identified archaeological remains around
nalanda
and this is a world heritage site unesco
world heritage
site so the core and buffer
zones of the site have been also mapped
so you can see
the this is the core zone and this is
the buffer zone
also the other features like the temple
and the monasteries
the water bodies surrounding them etc
have also been mapped
the green dotted boundary shows us the
extent of the entire archaeological site
then we come to the next very important
aspect that is called spectral
archaeology
uh meaning how we use spectral imaging
for
archaeological prospection now since
varied remains can change the chemical
physical and biological properties of
the local
soil their presence might be
expressed by phenological differences
that we see
as a manifestation of the spectral
reflectance or
growth of vegetation so height of the
vegetation may change
so there may be an anomaly that we
notice on the surface
so variation in the spectra
will be keys to detecting the
archaeological marks
so these marks are called soil marks or
vegetation marks right so in specific
cases
where the dominant land cover type over
archaeological sites is known
then the optimal spectral range can be
selected
in order to improve the efficiency of
archaeological observations
using this remotely sensed data what i
mean to say
is that if we are looking at the image
and there are some varied structures
underneath say like a wall that is
buried or some
other feature that is buried inside the
color of the soil on the top may be
different from that of the surrounding
so this will this will be an anomaly
that we need to look for and which will
be made
clear with the help of interpretation
techniques
also there may be changes in the normal
vegetation so maybe height of the
vegetation may be very less or very high
there may be an anomaly with the normal
surrounding
area so if we are able to mark these
changes
we will might be able to pinpoint an
area
which might give us a clue of something
to go for in excavation studies etc
so with multi-spectral remote sensing
uh we capture digital images of the area
in different spectral ranges by sensors
on board a remotely remotely placed
satellite platform
and we call it multispectral because
different regions of the spectrum
form channels or bands and each band
gives
us unique information in that spectral
region
now these spectrum regions can be
studied in terms of
the percentage reflectance from the
feature
in particular wavelength bands now if
you plot this data
we come up with a signature set called
a plot like this which is called the
spectral reflectance curve
and for different features these are
standard curves
any anomalies that happen can be mapped
and
can be studied through these spectral
reflectance curves these will give us
signatures
to study uh the manifestations of
features on the
ground which we see on the image
right so as i was telling you about
soil marks and you know
clues that these proxies will give us
crop
so here you see remote sensing images
that are depicting
features of varied archaeological
remains mostly
most of them through the above means
these these proxies spectral spatial
radiometric and temporal proxies
or clues such as crop or soil marks so
if you see here there is a varied ditch
here
and there is a buried wall here so with
these you see
this is here there is vigorous growth of
vegetation
this is the normal growth and here there
is a
stressed growth so that these two are
anomalies
and if we are able to map these and see
the
reflectance variations here due to the
vigorous growth because of the varied
pitch
and the stress growth due to the buried
wall we will these
reflectance variations if they are
we are able to pinpoint on the image
then we will be able to
get an idea of where to start the
exclamation mark
right then similarly as you see
this is an enhanced portion so the very
ditch can be seen and the buried wall
can also be seen here
and this is a diagrammatic
representation of the
electromagnetic spectrum and its
behavior
as we service the
anomalies
similarly here we see this is another
site in the czech
republic central european country
from 2006 to 12 to 15 and then
16. so here we it can also be seen on
this portal
so crop marks of about 200 pins
can be seen here in this
in these images of four different dates
now this is an image from syria
and here vandalism has been studied so
they have tried to display and detect
changes
due to looping here so if you see this
is very high resolution satellite data
and the mapping has been done of
areas that have been visibly
you know changed
through the time period
these are ground photographs of that
area so there are some
pits small locations here
so here this was a renewed phase of
severe war related looting
and which fresh fits clearly visible in
the same area
so here we can see in the ground
photographs also
now this is world view 3 multi-spectral
data
this has allowed the researchers here to
discover varied archaeological remains
near the roman
port city in tunisia so they have
worked with different kinds of
image processing techniques fused data
sets have been
used then pc has been done uh
filtering techniques have been also
applied
and then certain crop marks you know
certain
orthogonal equations have been applied
to get
orthogonal uh to get information about
vegetation crop mark and soil mark
and then these have all been clubbed
together in decision rule
and this interpretation has been done
these are corroborated by ground
photographs of the
area
then another study by dr rajni so again
here mapping has been done
this shows the extent and direction of
floods
this is done through list four study
done in 2007
simulated 3d perspective views have also
been shown
so the advantage of photogrammetry can
also be seen
similarly another similar study
then hyperspectral remote sensing also
forms as i said very important
part because it lets us see
a continuous spectrum narrow continuous
and therefore we get very detailed
spectral information high resolution
surface
spectral information which becomes very
useful for such
studies this is an example of detecting
crop marks
through airborne hyperspectral remote
sensing this is a study done
in austria and
ultimately the mapping was done for this
area
the data processes were implemented in
the matlab based
toolbox
then we come to microwave remote sensing
the advantage of microwave remote
sensing is that
it is time independent weather
independent so because some areas are
persistently cloud covered
and then we will not be able to do any
sensing there
this also penetrates vegetation dry soil
and dry snow
so any heritage structures buried under
such
features we will be able to study those
these are also sensitive to soil
moisture
vegetation and snow and it also has the
ability to collect data which are
further away from the flight path so
several advantages
the microwave data has
so as you can see optical data there are
clouds microwave data
the it has penetrated through the clouds
and therefore we get tearing
information very important for studying
you know buried features under
vegetation or under the soil and so on
so here you see
this is a sar and gpr based detection
over time so enzh and hv polar
polarized images have been used
okay so sub surface scattering this
is from the roman
forum current tool now here again
spot images they have revealed the radar
images have revealed
this is the optical image and elos
and l band and ctp brand images
so these images reveal varied and
previously unknown
paleo drainage channels which were
afterward also confirmed by field
studies
so this is the pulsar based detection
so ground penetrating radar data can
also be validated with this
so in the this is the study area in the
sahara desert and all the varied
features are very well visible
similarly we can also do very detailed
gpr based
investigations of course
the instrument is it is not very easy to
operate it for very large
areas however for small when we combine
it with
uh you know the interpretation done
through
uh earth observation data narrow down to
a prospective site and then
use the gpr or terrestrial laser scanner
etcetera
we will be able to do very detailed
mapping of varied structures as can be
seen in the examples here
then with photogrammetry we get 3d
information so quickly take you through
the concept
we need to image an object from
two different locations right as we do
with
in everyday life the eyes image an
object
twice and a three dimensional model is
formed
so it could be done from ground based
platforms
uav platforms aerial platforms or space
based platforms
we will show you examples in the coming
week how these techniques have been used
how close range photogrammetry has been
used how
uav bone based data has been used and
also from aerial and satellite
photogrammetry how it has been plugged
with the other data sets
so these are the broad or we can get an
automotive digital surface model
contours and topographic maps
of the study area so here we see a uav
derived
3d model image has been drained over it
these are ground photographs where we
see very small structures
like artifacts so pottery fragments etc
so since it is a uav image it will be
very high resolution probably
the tune of centimeters or millimeters
and therefore we are able to see
these in the mound here these mounds
were
interpreted and the area must have been
pinpointed
similarly this is an example to show you
integrated data set management
through this is space based data
this is a study that we did on the
naland
so contours have been generated 3d
models have been generated
all the information has been
complemented with each other put into a
rule set
and
it can be used as a visualization tool
now here you see 3d models from
ground-based technique
laser scanning and
terrestrial laser scan and close range
photogrammetry have been done
and these have been incorporated onto
the satellite image
or on the geoportal so this can be used
for visualization
similarly a time series analysis land
use land cover maps were made
for different time periods again the 3d
models have been put here
you can also see how the area has
changed over time
this is another area in new delhi
humayun which is also a unesco world
heritage site so you see a real 3d
realistic model which
can give you very precise measurements
has been
generated this was generated using
combined data from terrestrial laser
scanning
and close range photographs so
these were clubbed together and this
detailed 3d model was made
very detailed descriptions of these will
be shown and discussed with you in the
coming
lectures okay
so this is my instrument the same in a
zoomed out
portion so cartosat and list4
data has been used for visualization
contours have been generated from this
very high resolution
lulc map of the area this is where the
site is
so now you see on the lunc map
the monument the 3d model
which was generated
has been put this this model was
generated using ground based techniques
of
laser scanning and photogrammetry
terrestrial
photogrammetry similarly another example
from the kutub
the same technique was followed
terrestrial laser scanning
and close range photogrammetry combined
to give us
very high resolution 3d model
of the monument and measurements can be
taken very precisely on this this is
metric data
it has now we have club satellite data
and put it on top of that land use land
cover
map on the side the
dam superimposed with the satellite data
on those very high resolution controls
so these were examples that i wanted to
share with you and this
is now for lidar remote sensing laser
techniques are
which is also an active technique laser
platforms can be ground based
air based or space phone so this is the
terrestrial laser scanner
you can put a laser scanner on a uav you
can mount it on a vehicle and
move there are space-based platforms as
well
basically what is happening is that
lidar is a non-imaging technique it's a
range based technique
the laser sensor sends laser pulses
which strike the object and return to
the
sensor to the receiver and this
measurement gives us x y and z
information or vertical profile of the
scene
this is also able to penetrate to some
extent into water
and through vegetation canopies so this
like the sar
microwave sensors is also very useful
to study features which are buried under
vegetation
especially archaeological features so
here you see
this is the kind of 3d model very dense
point cloud is provided
this is a study demonstrating the mayan
architecture which were buried under
forest cover so you see this is the
forest cover
and through laser scanning one was able
to reconstruct
the shape of the structure even here
under vegetation this is the area in
optical data
in the image so all of it is covered
under vegetation
but through the laser sensor we are able
to see these
features under the canopy
then comes uav remote sensing uav is a
platform on which you can mount
different kinds of sensors it could be a
hyper spectrum sensors
sensor it could be a laser sensor a
microwave sensor and so on
uavs are useful because they are
lightweight and easy to transport
and they give us high spatial and
temporal resolutions
it also provides us quick availability
of raw data
now there are also some challenges that
is you know
which we have it is limited
you know by flight time depending on the
model or the camera weight and so on and
so forth
and it gives us a small footprint data
and
numerous images so we end up with a
large amount of data
so these are a few examples of the uav
studies that we have done this is the
bagan heritage site in myanmar
these are two pagodas that we studied
and this is the sula mani temple pagoda
these
have been this is a 3d model
superimposed on the
jio portal google earth
and a very detailed model of the pagoda
is seen here through uav images
similarly this is the other pagoda the
yar hong ki
now you can see the amount of detail
there was an earthquake in 2015
and the pagoda was damaged this entire
heritage site was
subjected to great damage now you can
see the detailed
information that is available all the
broken portions can be seen very easily
here this is the 3d model
this is the textured model on top of the
3d model
the image has also been drained this
data was captured through
uad so you see
this is the damaged portion and certain
study here satellite data versus the uav
data was
done what we see here is that satellite
data had some areas under shadow
so those could not be studied whereas
but they were damaged
whereas in the uav data those areas
because of the view and 360 view
those areas can also be studied easily
at much higher
spatial resolution so if you see here
these portions were under shadow in the
satellite data here so these are some of
the advantages that we
have in using uav data now we
i have been able to give you hope i have
been able to give you an
overview of all the techniques the
methods of image processing etc
in the coming lectures we will focus on
each technique one by one
ground based techniques and how to
detect damage
and how to document these through
laser scanning photogrammetry and
other such data sets
an association
uh question answer query session i have
received quite a few questions in the
chat box i will take them up one by one
um has asked
why google map of london provides 3d
images but google of delhi does not
provide 3d images
now mr saura this
is specifications put up by google so
on those or it may be a government
policy that you know high resolution in
data for
certain areas uh should not be shared
on such public platforms so these are
all
policy related matters uh those who
agree to share such data
with google and they sign agreements and
then such data is shared so you will
also notice that for certain areas
the high resolution data is also not
provided so though they may be sensitive
areas or strategic areas or any other
kind of
policy matter may be there so uh that
solely rests with the
platform and with the policy that they
have
adopted so that may be the reason
then we have aman mishra who wants to
know how
processing in how to process i think you
want to know how
image processing can be done after it is
the image is captured via satellite
uh mr raman i would like to point out
that
the
this explanation would be
a little difficult to give here because
it would be out of scope of this
course however i would suggest to you
that you follow
the basic course on remote sensing which
has the first module as remote sensing
and digital image processing
uh through the iirs digital platform
uh you will find several introductory
videos
which will or lectures which will tell
you how basic image processing is done
there are several courses which also
give you uh advanced image processing
techniques
uh and webinars also these will all be
available on through this
platform you can go through them one by
one and see which ones
uh you would like to go into detail
then we have radha indra who wants to
know is there a detailed online material
that explains how a 3d image is created
yes
again you could go to the same platform
the
dlp channel and there are several
courses that
we have done on photogrammetry satellite
photogrammetry
digital elevation model generation laser
lidar data processing and examples
demonstrations etc they are all
available there both image processing
remote sensing microwave data processing
etc
all these basic courses and advanced
webinars
advanced courses are all available there
so you could go through the material
there
through this platform
underground water so like aquifers or
underground rivers
these can be done very easily as you be
i have also shown you several examples
in the case examples that i showed you
that underground features are easily
detected through
gpr or earth observation systems like
microwave data and so on so and
depending upon at which scale you want
to do the interpretation
you can use these data sets to look at
underground
features paleo channels etc there were
several studies that i showed you in the
previous examples that we
went through
mishra has asked to define buffer and
core zone
actually these are areas specified
by management authorities for
features like heritage sites or national
parks and so on
so a specified area is taken up as the
core zone and
another specified area is taken as the
buffer zone so these are
areas marked out as per specifications
of the
management authority so these are the
specifications
okay i've already answered this about
the 3d information on google
why google map of london provide real
images
where we can zoom in and traverse inside
buildings but google map does
delhi does not that's the same reason
the kind of data that
the platform puts up in agreement with
the local authority or the government
that is the kind of data that is shared
on the public platform
so if such data was put up for delhi we
would have been able to do that
in fact there are several other
platforms or even on google
360 that you platforms like google 360
which let you see crowd source data and
mapped as 3d for 3d models for
visualization
can ash deposits of ancient sites be
identified
definitely um
we can use high resolution hyper
spectral data to do this
if you google you will see certain
research results related
studies but you will need high spectral
information
so it is advised to use uh hyperspectral
data of very high spatial resolution so
you could probably go for
ua hyperspectral sensor mounted on uav
platform
vivek kumar why we don't use lidar
sensing for navigation
i am not able to understand fully what
you want to know
but for navigation purposes we use gps
or gnss data
so that gives us coordinates so if we
want to attach what real
map coordinates to our data set we use
gps
or gnss data laser sensor is used for
high resolution 3d mapping
or where the feature is under vegetation
neema open source freely available data
sets with respect to photogrammetry and
later data sources etc
which we can use in such studies uh yes
in the forthcoming lectures you will be
told about
uh both open source data sets as well as
open source uh tools that are available
to process these data sets a few tools
have been
developed at iirs so the faculty will
make you aware and show you them as a
little
make you aware of those also so they
will come in the forthcoming lectures
this question was already taken up can
we detect underground water bodies
how underground excavations are possible
through uav without disturbing the
residential and vegetative
areas i think you have misunderstood
uh with the help of these geospatial
techniques either through uav or
space-based platforms or ground-based
platforms we are not doing actual
excavation
what we are doing is that we are
pinpointing these suitable sites for
such
excavations now excavations if it is
residential etcetera meditative areas if
you need to dig
deep inside then they will obviously
disturb
but through these techniques it is that
we are only doing mapping
and we are trying to pinpoint the
possible areas for such
activities
anurag yadav says how deep can we
laser scan a surface by terrestrial
laser scanner
it yes it depends on the wavelength
however
the terrestrial laser scanners are not
very advisable to
you know do a surface scan a deep
surface scan
they are more suitable laser scanners
are usually more
suitable for studying area under
vegetation etc or where you require
very high resolution height information
what is the difference between uav data
and lidar data now uav
is a platform on which you can mount
a lidar sensor or any other kind of
sensor
like a sar sensor or a optical sensor or
a hyperspectral sensor
so a uav that is an unmanned aerial
vehicle is a platform
and lidar is a sensor
it was a very nice session thank you uh
what about detection of oceanic
complexities or life below deep water
yes this is this forms a very
interesting aspect of heritage studies
or archaeological studies that is marine
archaeology and we can study by taking
cameras etc
underground or doing sonar studies
we can look at features that are buried
under water however we have not been
able to include that here those examples
here
um since we had to compress the course
we focused on very limited aspects but
yes this forms a very very important
part
and in maybe coming sessions later on
when things become more normal and we do
a more detailed course we could take
this up
several shipwrecks uh cities buried
underneath like the dwarka
vet dwarka in off the coast of gujarat
have been studied through these
this technique
is a great session thank you mr noob
will there be
any difference in future if we use irnss
in space of gps these are both used for
navigation and
calculating coordinates so these are
different systems
uh we are working in the you know
wherever you need to establish
high resolution precise coordinates we
will be you
need to use these gps systems or the ir
ss system
3d viewing how does it help in
construction of heritage
how can we gain information by
how is it helpful uh well actually
creating information will
give you an idea of the
terrain on which the heritage structure
is
so this will help you to you know
generate mapping potentials
for the heritage site
this is mr vijay kumar patil also
already answered that
measurements of a buried or outside
structure using sensor so
my colleagues will also be taking up
lectures on microwave remote sensing and
gpr
and there i think your doubts will be
cleared better so
these kind of sensors can be used for
studying varied structures
okay i thank everybody for the
appreciation that you have given
and i hope you have a very fruitful
learning time in the
coming week thank you very much
you 








Transcript
okay
good afternoon everyone i welcome you
all in the second session
of the second session of the course
on geospatial technologies for
archaeological
applications the topic for today's
session
is ground based optical remote sensing
for archaeological
studies i am dr namaste
and i will be dealing with what are the
ground-based optical remote sensing
technology
and their application for archaeological
studies
so yesterday uh you have been told
about how uh remote sensing can be used
for
archaeological studies and ah
you have seen that uh the
optical as well as microwave hyper
spectral remote sensing can be used for
identification of sites archaeological
sites
they are mapping the landscape of the
archaeological
area also they are used for
exploring the new uh sites
which are which would be useful for uh
archaeological exploration
or they are the on the remote sensing
technology is also
used for making buffer zones
so as to protect the heritage
area now once these archaeological sites
are
identified and they are
they are means known to us
the heritage that we discuss
we have some built monuments
also and we have some certain artifacts
built monuments in these archaeological
areas
and our technology the ground-based uh
technology would be mainly focusing on
uh how to uh create a 3d model of these
monuments
of archaeological importance also
how to
how to know what was there
previously um doing the damage
assessment of the monuments
of uh of the heritage monuments
how we can automatically
the damage detection how we can create
the uh the digital documentation
of these archaeological monuments now as
you already know
that for any building for any monument
for any building we require a 3d uh
autocad drawing so for these monuments
we don't have such type of drawings
available with
us because these monuments were built
we don't have these drawings so now if
we create
a very high quality 3d models of
external as well as interior of the
monument
we can create the 3d
digital blueprint of these monuments
and these 3d digital blueprints of the
monuments can be used for
restoration purpose of these monuments
if
there is some calamity or if they
require certain
restoration so that would be the topic
for
tomorrow's class today we will be seeing
what are the techniques of ground based
remote sensing
which can be used for archaeological
applications
and in this technology in this
session we will be talking about
the 3d mapping techniques ground-based
3d mapping techniques
now because as i have already told you
that our basic idea
is to generate 3d models dense 3d models
of these monuments
and um for
generating the 3d monument and 3d
3d models we will be utilizing certain
techniques
and one by one i we will be discussing
these techniques and how these
techniques can be used
for uh heritage uh documentation
so first of all you must have heard
about the technology photogrammetry
technology technique
so this photogrammetry is an image based
technique
in which the images are captured from
multiple
angles from various directions the
images are captured
and the dents or sparse 3d point cloud
is generally
the photogrammetry when we are using the
camera on the
ground we call it as terrestrial
photogrammetry
so i will be explaining the procedure of
terrestrial photogrammetry as well as
how this technology is being used for
monument for creating 3d models of the
monuments so this terrestrial
photogrammetry is
quite cheap but
it requires the expertise
of the operator is required
now the next technique is range based
techniques
now in this range based technique as you
must be aware that we
have these laser scanners so laser
scanners can be used
and these laser scanners they generate
very dense 3d point cloud
they are very fast very easy to use
but naturally the instrument of the
laser is quite expensive some of the
instruments are bulky also
but there are a new fewer models that
are now available in the market
which are not so bulky and they are
handy also
to generate the 3d
point cloud or 3d
database we can also use surveying
methods
which are classical surveying methods
such as total station
gps but these surveying methods they are
only able to give us
very sparse point cloud and these uh
sparse points will have very low density
very very low
resolution and uh and they are quite
time consuming also
so we will be focusing on the first two
methods that is image based method that
is terrestrial photogrammetry
and reach range based method that is
laser scanning so one by one we will be
looking at this technology what is the
basic concept of this technology
and how this technique can be used for
3d documentation of cultural heritage
sites
now going into a little bit more detail
about
the range based 3d modelling and image
based 3d modelling what are the benefits
and what are the
disadvantages of these technologies
so in the range-based 3d modeling that
is terrestrial laser scanner we
are able to get very high vertical
accuracy that means
uh height or depth accuracy is very high
these are very easy to use you can only
set up the
instrument and it does the scanning of
the entire area
itself there are certain scanners which
provide
us the full waveform data also instead
of discrete points it
gives us full waveform data also and
this full waveform
samples the return signal very rapidly
and stores the entire back scattered
energy of the
emitted pulse so in this
full waveform data apart from range so
apart from
depth we are able to get other physical
properties
such as the width the amplitude of the
returning wave and these properties can
be used to
identify the material also okay
so um these this
was about the range-based 3d modeling
the terrestrial photogrammetry in
terrestrial photogrammetry
we can have instantaneous or rapid image
acquisition
if you have a camera you can use that
camera and
capture the photographs then in there
now
what we have observed and we have
experimented also here at iis is that
any type of camera can be used for
terrestrial photogrammetric
applications even the mobile phone
cameras
can be used after a certain um
after a certain procedure is followed
you can use even your mobile phone
cameras
so and that procedure is also very
simple that procedure would be the
calibration of your
camera so after calibration of the
camera any type of camera can be used
for
photogrametric application for
terrestrial photography
now because the camera is with you
so the cost of acquisition processing
and analysis is
very less compared to the other
technique compared to the range based
technique
it is also the terrestrial
photogrammetry is also providing
high accuracy and it is very portable
and flexible because you can use any
camera you can
take it anywhere whereas in case of
laser scanners the instrument
sometimes is bulky you have to set up
that instrument
and ah take the 3d model
so one by one we will be looking into
these techniques so starting with
terrestrial photogrammetry
now photogrammetry as we understand
is the science of quantitative analysis
of measurements from the photographs
so making precise
three-dimensional measurements from the
photographs is the method
is the technique of photogrammetry now
photographs are two-dimensional
from this two-dimensional photograph how
we can derive and derive the third
dimension also and this third dimension
is the
depth in case of terrestrial
photogrammetry in case of aerial and
satellite photogrammetry it becomes as
height also okay so how we are able to
do this
is is very simple we are observing
this photogrametric uh visualization in
our day-to-day life
we all are having uh we are
all are able to visualize which object
is closer to us and which object is far
away from us
and this we are able to do because we
are having two eyes and these two eyes
are situated at two different positions
so the photograph or the image is
captured from first eye image is
captured from second eye of the same
object
in the brain the stereographic
processing is
carried out and we are able to generate
the 3d model of the
area similarly in for photogrammetry
what we do
is we capture the photograph of that
object
from multiple positions multiple view
angles we
are capturing the uh
photograph of the object and then we
perform certain operations by which we
recreate the same condition as it
existed at the time of photography that
means we are recreating
the conditions at what distance the two
photographs were captured
what was the orientation of photograph
one what was the orientation of
photograph two
and so on like this ah certain
mathematical equations have to be
solved but the computer does it the
software does it
itself so this is how
we are able to generate 3d models and
once we have the 3d model
we can make precise measurement over
this 3d model
this 3d model using certain ground
control points we can correlate its
coordinates to the ground coordinates
also
and once we have done that we can make
the
precise measurements on this 3d model
so based on where the camera has been
placed the photogrammetry can be of
three different
types that is aerial
satellite and terrestrial photometry in
aerial and satellite photogrammetry the
distance between the
object and the camera is quite high
that is why these are also called as far
range photography the terrestrial
photogrammetry is also
termed as close range photogrammetry
because the distance between the camera
and the object is less
so this is the basic principle of
photogrammetry
as you can already see the object
is captured from two different positions
the same object is captured from uh
position a o a and position
o b from o a image a
is created from the position
using these photographs when we recreate
the same conditions
as it existed at the time of photography
that means when we find out the
camera position and the camera
orientation
at the time of photography then we are
able to generate
a 3d model of the object
the entire
procedure or the processing of
in which we calculate the camera
position and camera orientation
is called as orientation of the
photograph so in the orientation of the
photographs the location of each
camera's perspective center
perspective center means the position of
camera at time of photography
and the rotation of camera about its
axis
are generated and once that is done
if by using image matching we can
generate
the dense point cloud we will be not
going into the details of photogrammetry
here
if you wish to understand uh in depth
about the photogrammetry you can go to
our
other lectures on 3d modelling
so that has complete details about
terrestrial photogrammetry and even
aerial and satellite photochemistry in
the previous lectures in the previous
courses we have discussed it in detail
here in this course we are dealing only
we will be dealing only with the
application of the technology in the
area of
archaeological excavation and monitoring
and studies
okay so now terrestrial photogrammetry
has been used um extensively
for archaeological studies so i am here
showing
you a few examples where
around the world the terrestrial
photogrammetry was used for
creating 3d models of important
archaeological artifacts and boilings
so this one this slide explains
the uh 3d model generation of
beyond buddha tower in angkor wat in
cambodia
as you can see here the uh multiple
photographs to be precise 16 number of
photographs were captured
from all around the buddha tower
as you can see the position of the
cameras is listed out here
position one two three four you must be
seeing that
in all the position of the camera the
cameras are placed in such a way so that
the optical axis of the camera
is oriented towards the center of the
uh monument or center of the object
so this is required when we are doing
terrestrial photogrammetry when we are
taking
multiple photographs so it should take
the photographs in such a manner so that
the optical axis
is converging so that is why terrestrial
photogrammetry is sometimes known as
multi-station convergent photography
okay i will again repeat it multi
station
convergent photography multi station
because
you can you can capture the photograph
from multiple
stations from multiple positions as here
in this particular slide we have they
have
taken the photograph from 16 different
positions
and it is convergent photography
convergent in the sense that
all the optical axis should be
converging at the center of the
object so once this
is done you can do the orientation of
these photographs now i have shown you
the photographs also
you can see these are this is the
photograph for the buddha tower
this is the photograph and the 3d model
has been generated just once again
this is the 3d model for buddha tower
of cambodia okay you can
display it in a real color
you can give the color from the
photographs also
or what you can do is in form of ram
color
ramp also you can display it now
once you have created this 3d model i
will show you in
the studies that were done in iaers that
how these 3d models can be used for
various other applications this creation
of 3d model is one thing
using this 3d model you can do a proper
documentation of this monument
you can do damage detection of the
monument if there are a certain cracks
there are missing portions
you can do a damage detection there are
other applications also which i will be
discussing
by the end of this lecture okay
so another example of utilization of
terrestrial photogrammetry for creation
of
3d model of archaeological sites
this is made gorgeous church this church
as you can see
you can see here it is you know
it is in a gorge
that is why the name has been given here
okay
okay it is in ethopia then ah
here again we have shown you the
position of camera
at the time of photography and the
position of camera so you can see
so many photographs were captured all
along the church okay and
this 3d model was generated this is
another church
done by university of hanover this is a
byzantine church
these are all of archaeological
importance
okay so you can see here the camera
has been placed here and it is being
captured
the photographs are captured and
ultimately the dense 3d model is
generated
okay i think all of you must be knowing
about this bamiyan
buddhas bamiyan buddhas
were very tall buddha statues
made a carved out of stone in
afghanistan
the militants the talibanis they
put bombs here and exploded and they
destroyed these bamiyan buddhas
so this was a unesco um
world heritage site and what uh
later on after the destruction what
after that only people
realize that we should try to protect
our
uh archaeological heritage and first of
all we should first of all
do the documentation absolute
documentation of our
monuments and uh suppose there is
because of some earthquake because of
some calamity
war some monument gets destructed then
something can be done for restoration of
these
monuments also so using the
this was a big project at that time
using the
um using the
pieces of the bamiyan buddha
multiple the terrestrial photogrammetry
was carried out and
virtually they were reconstructed the
bamiyan buddha statues were
reconstructed but virtually
so this is the area of bamiyan bunda
this is there were two statues one was a
larger one
called as great buddha and one was
smaller one which was called as
small
destroyed the act okay
so a terrestrial photogrammetry
utilization of
terrestrial photogrammetry for
documentation
we gained momentum from this project
okay now as you must be aware that early
man he
they used to draw some drawings on the
stone on the caves where
they resided so these are called as
petrographs and not only the monuments
these petrol
glyphs also can be
documented can be the 3d monument
or 3d uh documentation can be done for
these also so this was done for palpa
area in india also we are also having
lot of petroglyphs petroglyphs are
the drawings on the stones
done by early man
as you can see here this is a very um
well this is some carving on the
on a church or some monument
so five images were captured for this
particular
um for this particular carving
and what i want to show you is that even
in the photographs
the details are not very clear whereas
in the 3d model
the exact details are clear
okay because in the 3d model we also
have the depth information
okay so such type of work can be very
very useful for
restoration for further
work in monument area a very small
uh buddha statue just 50 centimeter by
30 centimeter
and was captured from
the terrestrial photographs were
captured you can see
the buddha statue has been reconstructed
okay so these are some examples by which
you can understand that how terrestrial
photogrammetry can be used for
uh ident for for
creating 3d models and these 3d models
now this 3d
model is not the ultimate thing this 3d
model can be
used for various other applications
a few of the applications we will be
discussing in course of today's and
tomorrow's lecture
some of the case studies that we did at
iars i am going to show you
these are all done using
okay so uh sorry for that interruption
there was some
technical issue there was some lagging
in this slide show so i will try to take
care and
now these are the cultural heritage
that were carry uh these studies were
carried out at iirs using terrestrial
photogrammetry
so clock tower indoor gillespie's
monument as you can see
um the every monument has been
captured from multiple camera locations
then the wireframe model can be
generated for every monument you can see
wireframe model is generated after that
shaded model is generated and later on
the texture from the photograph is
pasted here
and the photorealistic texture is
generated
now this is another monument here in
their
doom that is buddha temple so this is
a very huge monument
and multiple photographs were captured
for this monument and as you can see
here
the camera stations our list are given
here
the shaded model and the point cloud
3d point cloud is generated after
giving the texture to this texture model
i wanted to show you
how much detailing can be done using
terrestrial photogrammetry
so you can see the top collage
of the monument that is placed on the
top of the
lotus flower that is also clear
the single means the petals of the
lupus flower even though this monument
is very
tall very high then also
everything was clearly picked up by the
3d model
another structure
of heritage importance in ia in their
doom is forest research institute
a very a huge building
mavic houses the forest research
institute
so um a total of 56 photographs were
captured
throughout um from all around that uh
building
and this building was also the 3d model
was
generic okay so these are certain
studies
to show you how terrestrial
photogrammetry can be used for
3d model generation
this is the realistic reconstruction of
iirs campus there are various buildings
in iaers campus
so multiple buildings were created the
trees were created
so you can see a complete reconstruction
of the
campus was carried out so like this and
this was done using terrestrial
photogrammetry
and very low
instruments was were used okay
these are different buildings within the
iars
campus
now uh to carry out
the
open source photogram terrestrial
photogrammetry iaers has come up with
the
open source application which is called
as thriving
premium utilizes only um
only the camera or smartphones and
generates the geo reference 3d models
so
the inputs that are required for trivium
are
overlapped sequence of photograph
location of camera
transistor and footprint of building
and some sort of 3d models can be
generated
using premium privem is an open source
freeware application and it
it is available at india iirs
site so the output that is
generated here is georeference 3d model
and the beauty of this geo reference 3d
model is that
it contains the database also so suppose
um in one building there are
multiple floors are there so you can
slice the building into various floors
and
put the database accordingly or what you
can do within one floor different shops
are there different apartments are there
so you can put the database of
individual apartments also the database
is
can be the structure of databases
can be done using the operator whoever
wants to create
whatever database they can input that
type of database so someone can be
interested in
how many people are residing what is the
socioeconomic condition of that
of the people in that building or
someone can be
interested in any other database so
this type of uh low cost solution
can be used for uh can be used for
augmented reality for spatial data
infrastructure
for urban governance for potential tax
estimation for property management
it can be also used by department of
tourism ministry of culture
for so many applications are
there okay now
coming to the next technology that is
laser
lidar light detection and ranging
so lidar is laser based remote sensing
technology a small point a
small laser at a surface and measures
the time it takes for the laser to
return
to it so so what is done is laser is an
active sensor now there are two types of
sensors
passive sensors are the one which take
the energy of the sun
okay which uses utilizes the energy of
the
sun the active sensors are the one which
give out their own energy this energy
is sent towards the object
towards the target it strikes the target
and it comes back to
the sensor the time of flight between
the
between the sending and receiving of
this energy
is noted down and based on certain other
parameters
the precise information about the target
or terrain can be
generated the advantage of active remote
sensing
is that it can be done during day or
night
it can compare the energy sent and
energy received so we can also know
uh how much energy has been reflected
how much is
absorbed so we can know what is the type
of
target and it makes mapping possible
through the vegetation
in low contrast situations or shadow
areas
as you must have been told in
yesterday's session that
in highly vegetated areas laser scanning
can be done
to know what lies beneath the
canopy
laser is gives us a discrete data
and it provides the precise details of
the
scene the complete vertical profile of
the
scene can be generated it can also
penetrate into
water and a canopy
the
as you already know that we can have
multiple returns from the laser
or we can also have first return last
return or
a complete waveform from the laser data
laser as a sensor can be put on any type
of platform you can put it on
satellite you can put on aerial
a drone you can put it on moving vehicle
or you can put it on make it as
static laser scanner also what we will
be doing is
using terrestrial laser scanner the
static one for
archaeological applications
so now coming to terrestrial laser
scanner
the laser emitted from the scanner hits
the object
and is reflected back so as you can see
here in the figure
in the diagram the laser scanner
is emitting the laser it
strikes the object and it comes back and
it is reflected back towards the
sensor now the sensor catches this
reflected energy
the time of flight is calculated how
much time
has been taken in going and coming back
of the laser
and xyz coordinates are calculated using
that
terrestrial laser scanner is a
non-contact surveying method
of gathering thousands and thousands of
points in few minutes
using terrestrial laser scanner entire
region both
inside and outside the defined window
can be scanned in minutes
also the laser scanner gives us the
accuracy of the points
in centimeter and millimeters in
range of millimeters this
diagram shows what are the steps of
laser data processing the laser data
processing and data acquisition it
starts with planning of the project
how because you have to plan properly
from where you are going to place the
laser scanner what
positions laser scanner would be placed
so as you can get the most
efficient data acquisition
from these number of
laser positions
so once the data the data has to be
collected using tls
gps photographs anything then
because one single monument or one
single building would not
be covered in one scan so multiple scans
would be required for
covering one particular object
so to
stitch these scans together
you require registration or geo
referencing of scans from
single campaign once you have done that
there would be certain noise elements
also which have come
so such as any noise that you don't
require
so you can do the editing and cleaning
of that point cloud data
once this point cloud is ready
you can export it into any type of
format
and you can do any type of
processing or any type of application
using
this particular point cloud you can
integrate it with other data
effects you can do photorealistic
modeling
you can do surface modeling you can do a
combination of scan data from multiple
companies for mult
for time series analysis and so on
okay we will not once your
data is collected as you can see here
the terrestrial laser scanner data
is something like this in this black and
white form
okay so uh later on you would like to
incorporate the color or the texture
from your photographs
onto this point cloud so for that
you there is a camera that is put
along with the terrestrial laser scanner
and
using that photographs of that camera
the
point cloud xyz coordinates or each
point
has been is given the rgb values the red
green and blue values so that
you feel that the
point cloud is colored now
so these are the raw point cloud for
some of the iirs buildings as you can
see here
what i want to show you here is that
the detail the level of detail that can
be taken from terrestrial laser scanner
so we have taken one scan and from
there was a porch in front of the
burning a
door was there the glass door is there
and inside the door there is a veranda
and
after that the stairs are there so you
can see when i have zoomed
show you a magnified view even the
stairs are so clearly
visible similarly in the second image
when we zoom it in an area
whether the window panes are open closed
each and every detail
is seen here okay at this moment we have
not incorporated the
colors to the um to the
tls scan
okay so now this how uh this
terrestrial laser scanner can be used
for
digital documentation of cultural
heritage site
so but we have carried out certain
studies so i will be showing you
this is uh saint mary's church in
lansdowne area
it was constructed in the year 1895
very old churches there so data
acquisition was carried out
the tls scan was
taken from outside as well as
inside of the church once this tls
scan was done you can see all the scans
were co-registered
and a complete 3d model of the church
was generated
this 3d model was also provided color
from the photograph you can see the
color is
seen here now for documentation
and easy access the point cloud was then
unrolled in so that the distortions are
not
there the point cloud was also
rasterized at different resolutions as
you can see here
five millimeter 10 millimeter 20
millimeter this was all
done so that because the point cloud is
very very heavy
so many lags and lots of points so
the file becomes very heavy so the
display of the data becomes
very difficult and when we want to
identify when we want to apply
any image processing application on this
supposed to
find out where are the cracks in this
building okay
so if we apply it on the highest
possible resolution
it becomes very very difficult for the
computer to operate
because the data is so heavy so what we
do is we do it on
the lowest resolution if we find
something
then we go on
simply the display of the
point cloud also becomes difficult uh
when it is very heavy point cloud
on the web environment now the
same buddha temple that i have shown you
or which we have done using terrestrial
photogrammetry
the same one we have done using
terrestrial laser scanner also
so you can see this is the buddha statue
i have shown
a magnified view of the stairs and
this is a buddha sorry buddha temple and
buddha statue this is a huge buddha
statue
in the same complex and we have not
we have kept the terrestrial laser
scanner on the ground itself
still you can see even on the top of the
statue at the head of um
[Music]
head of the deity also is
showing all the details the each and
every carving everything is
so clearly seen here
similarly for clock tower the one i have
shown you
the using uh terrestrial photogrammetry
the same thing was done using
terrestrial laser scanner also okay
so terrestrial is a scanner as you must
be observing is
able to give us very dense point cloud
okay but
then again terrestrial laser scanner
is expensive not available for everyone
to
use like we have
created premium for terrestrial
photogrammetry
we have come up with a new application
for digital health assessment using
range and optical data for heritage
and archaeological restoration how we
can utilize this uh
tls point cloud for archaeological
applications so this application is
called as dharohar
and it has it is basically
done uh it is basically developed for
uh visualization of point cloud using
terrestrial laser scanner
how if we have two different point
clouds we can co-register
the entire methodology that we have
developed in the uh
for our application we have brought this
methodology here
so how the point cloud can be how
damages can be detected
so all that is done it can be done using
this application
and dharohar stands for digital health
assessment
using range and optical data for
heritage and archaeological restoration
so prototype framework for damage
detection using point clouds
and multi-scale representation for
assessment and
reconstruction
now with that background work that we
have done
iaers has done one
project on 3d digital documentation
damage assessment and reconstruction of
cultural heritage sites
what we have done is we have taken up
unesco world heritage sites of mayans
tomb
kutub complex in delhi area and nalanda
mahavihar
in bihar these three sites were taken up
for detailed
um analysis using
the terrestrial laser scan and we
the study was focused on comprehensive
3d digital documentation
architectural primitive extraction 3d
digital blueprinting
damage detection and virtual
reconstruction and conjectural
reconstruction
so 3d modelling is not the only
thing that can be done using periscope
laser scanner once this 3d model is
generated
you can use that 3d model for variety of
application which can be used for
archaeological studies
and these are few of the applications
that we have carried out
so i will show you the results of this
uh these are the
study sites that we have taken up
this is mindstrome in delhi
complex again in delhi and within this
complex as you must be aware
there are multiple buildings out there
and we have done
the 3-d modeling of the entire complex
area 3d digital document
of entire area
and myostome has been done in tomorrow's
lecture we will be disc
we will be showing you how this
automatic 3d documentation
and digital blueprinting of the
monuments as well as damage detection
was carried out using
3d point cloud generated through
terrestrial laser scan
now this is the final
3d point cloud using uh terrestrial
laser scanner this is for kuthum
this is for humayun's tomb and for
nalanda mahavira
these are individual uh individual
objects individual monuments within the
various complexes so uh in the
complex these are the broken arches as
you must be aware there are two sets of
arches one in front of iron pillar and
one in front of
me so we have done certain other study
also on these broken arteries
so these are the the 3d models 3d point
cloud
collected using terrestrial laser
scanner
okay these are the within the
complex uh there are a lot of pillars
are there a
pillared gallery is there so this is
a pillar from that gallery this is
alaimina which is an incomplete miner
within the
complex this was also supposed to be
similar to kutum
but was never completed this is a tomb
of imam's army
in the complex area
these are nalanda mahavira within that
there are various monasteries so this is
the
3d point cloud of monastery one so
this there are various monasteries and
various temples
so these 3d point cloud we have uh
placed on 3d models have been
placed on the satellite data
satellite derived in ulc information
so
for various applica areas these are the
textured point clouds
okay i will show you
one virtual
just i'm really sorry that file is not
opening
now i will show you this video
okay so this is the point cloud of the
entire
complex area okay now such type of
coin clouds can be used for virtual
tourism also okay virtual tourism
in the sense these suppose in this time
because of the current scenario we are
not able to
move around we are not able to go to
other places
okay so such type of 3d documents or 3d
models can be generated off for a
particular area
and virtual tourism can be done in this
model
i we have not done a lot of editing and
some blank areas you can see
but this can this is doable it is
it can be easily done so this is you can
see this is
you can move around also what you can do
is you can add certain documentary also
here
okay such as when it was created
and create a complete um
virtual look okay
so this was the pillar gallery that i
was talking about
these are the pillars that i was talking
about the pillared gallery
um in the coming slides i will
be telling you that how these okay that
is alive in our
the incomplete minar
within the complex area
this is alaimina
okay now coming to the other part
there are various other buildings here
okay you can just walk around
and do a commentary and
the entire thing can be
it can come up as a virtual
tour
okay you can see the carving of on the
top
the pillars the carving on the pillars
this is the iron pillar which never
rusts
these are the broken arches that i was
talking about
okay
now because the
movement is so fast that is why um
at some places you are feeling that the
number of points are
less but the number of points are very
high
and you can have the exact x y
the beauty is that you can have exact x
y z coordinates of
each and every point here for each and
every
point xyz coordinates now i will show
you the detailing that can be obtained
using
the terrestrial laser scan you can see
you can see each and every carving is
visible
okay like this you can generate
a virtual tour of the entire area so
what i will do is i will stop it here
and we will continue with our
presentation
because
i i want to show you the other
applications also
okay now since you have seen the virtual
tour
what now this point cloud was
used for various other applications also
now one of this application is
conjectural reconstruction
conjectural means we are assuming that
this should have been ah like this
okay so now what we have done we have
seen that in the
area we have found these broken arches
okay
they were not broken from always at some
point of time
they they were when they were
constructed they were
in charge so at that time how they were
okay so how to see that so what we have
done is we have
um we have looked into the previous
literature and got a very old map
of that complex area this map was
is can be has been taken from a book
which is the world heritage complex of
puttu
and this map was created in
um 1316. so in this 1316 map
the the extra the complete
arches are seen here i have shown it in
with a red box you can see here so in
1316 these arches were complete now
these are broken
so what we have done is use we have a
geo reference to this map
scaled this map and
scaled it with respect to our 3d model
of today okay and then what we have done
is we have because this map
has a complete
arches so what we have done is at what
angle we have
identified we have calculated the angle
dimension and angular measurement of the
complete
arts were done using the geo-referenced
map
after that we have established a
mathematical relationship between these
arches the angular measurement of the
arches and
the angular measurements of our broken
arches
a simile was a mathematical relationship
was estimated
and finally the dimension and shape for
reconstruction was
that so you can see here this was
conjecturally
restored virtually only so these
are the broken arches the black line
depicts the broken arches that are
standing at
the complex in today's time
and sorry sorry and this red
line is the uh conjecturally
reconstructed based on the
map of 1316 once this was done in the
form of the line diagram a 3d model was
also created you can see a 3d model was
created
and this 3d model was textured also
textured based on the texture of the
today's pillar and this is the actual
ground scenario you can see here
if any one of you have visited kutum
this is a very iconic photograph of
kutum
uh taken from in between these broken
arches
so this is the actual ground scenario
and this is
this should have been the scenario in
1316.
this is conjectured scenario okay
so you can see how this once we have
this 3d model
this 3d model can be used for various
applications so this is one of the
application
similar thing was again done as i was
showing you in the in the walkthrough
model i was showing you
the pillared
so the same map was used for
reconstruction of this
pillared gallery you can see the gallery
was
uh in 1316 the entire
area was having this type of gallery
okay now only a small portion is
remaining
so what we have did what we did is
conjecturally we have restored the
entire
um entire this
pillared gallery
okay so this entire area has been
conjecturally reconstruct and you can
see here
this is the zoomed in version of the of
a part of
the pillared in gallery
from which i have shown you in the
walkthrough also
and this is the when we put
texture also on it
now another thing that we have done in
our studies was
estimation of tilt off and this all
was done using pls point cloud so tls
point cloud was taken as the base for
all these studies so uh what we have
done is because
asi they reported that
is getting tilted in the southwest
direction so what we did was we have
i think we have this entire um
point cloud of the complete um
so what we did and you must be knowing
that this
has various stories okay one two three
four
and then top uh is there okay so what we
did was we have
visualized the point cloud from the top
you can see this is
the top the top point was taken and we
have
marked the circle for every uh story
because at every story there is a
gallery
okay so we have
made that done certain calculations and
what we found
is that the certain
amount of tilting is there we have
identified the plumb line of straight
minar
and plumb line of tilted miner how much
angle of tilt is there
and then we correlated it with the asi
document
asi document was done was carried out in
the year 1964. they have done the
calculation and i think in
the year 80s or something
they have done certain restoration so
after that restoration work in the
southwest direction uh
after that the tilting has stopped now
it is no more tilting but
till that time till the um there was
some
channel of yamuna flowing from below
something was there
because of which it was tilting so we
have done
all the calculations and correlated with
the asi measurements
so asi measurements were done on the
ground
we have done the measurements on the
point cloud so
this is the advantage of having the
point cloud
now another application is virtual
relocation of the statues now this is
this was done in the nalanda mahabharata
so as you must be aware that
was a university in which there were
certain temples there were certain
monasteries and
in the monasteries the students used to
stay
there were rooms in the monasteries for
the students lodging
was there and in the temples
while the excavation was done uh there
a lot of statues were also excavated
okay um but these statues were taken out
from their
uh position and they were kept in the
museum
so that they are protected from the
weather and
from some other killer so now
but for these statues the exact position
from where they have been
excavated is known to us so what we did
was
we have created the 3d model of the
temple
okay this is the 3d model of the temple
we
went to the museum and in the museum we
have
taken the 3d model of these statues also
now two virtual things we have placed
this statue
exactly on the position from which it
was
excavated this we have done for various
statues in
now once we have placed these statues
and once and
now we create a walk-through model so it
will appear that the statues are
sitting there and at the time of
excavation how they were
looking so you can see here these
for all these nagraj statue for standing
buddha for bodhisattva statue
all for all of them we have done the
relocation virtual
relocation of these statues so this is
another application that can be
done we can also generate
3d model of various artifacts that are
available that are present after the
excavation
in the museum so these are some of the
artifacts which we have taken from the
museum so this is the nalanda seal
[Music]
when the excavation was carried out
after uh
many years we the archaeologists were
able to
say that this is nalanda side when the
seal of the university was found at that
site
then only they were able to confirm that
this site is
the university okay these are the
vessels
huge vessels are there because i as i
already told you in the monastery
the students used to stay so they are
these are the cooking vessels which were
found from the monasteries
okay so the relocation virtual
relocation of all these statues all
these artifacts was
carried out was done virtually using the
3d model
so these are few of the applications
which can be done
using once we have the 3d model so these
are
just some of ones that i have shown you
there can be others also
um we will be two of them we will be
discussing tomorrow
especially on the damage detection how
to
know how much damage is happening uh
estimating the damage the cracks and all
those
identification of cracks and the second
one is as i have already told
the complete digital documentation blue
printing of the
monument okay so today i have told you
how to
generate 3d model how to generate
virtual tour of the model
and some other applications of these 3d
models the
main application of the 3d model that is
the digital blueprinting we will be
discussing
tomorrow so thank you all
uh for attending this session
you can post your questions we will be
taking up your
questions in adjust strive for now
thank you so much
question answer session so we have uh
some questions
if you have any further doubt you can
post your question in the chat box
so um one of our colleagues he wants to
uh ask can we reconstruct damaged
heritage
using 3d pin printing technology in
future
yes theoretically it is possible but
pd printing can be done for small
artifacts only
for the entire monument it will be
difficult at this moment because
we don't have such big 3d printers
small even the small parts of the
monument also
will be very huge okay but theoretically
it is possible for artifacts you can
easily do at the moment
then what are the softwares used for
processing data from
space or airborne based scanning
can trivium be used here as well no
freemium has been
developed only for terrestrial
photogrammetry not even for
laser scan for laser scanning for
archaeological application we have
developed so there are various
applications
there are various processing softwares
for uh space
and laser satellite and aerial laser
scanning
lidar analyst is there there are various
for every because what happens is
the um sensor that you are using along
with the sensor you get the
software otherwise there are some
softwares such as
leica has one software arcgis
s3 also has one software for laser
analysis
okay and then we have can we use
remote sensing to analyze present day
buildings
from just
from like we did in case of monuments to
prevent accidents and reconstruction of
building yes definitely why not
it can be done for any type of buildings
okay
what is difference between video and 3d
models in virtual tour
now video is only
for visualization you cannot do the
measurement on the visual
video whereas in the 3d model you can do
a 3d pin pointing means
exact x y and z coordinates also can be
can be noted down can be measured so
the applications that i have shown you
for
3d models cannot be done using videos
okay
can we use ground-based remote sensing
for minor detail of constructed building
yes we i will be uh discussing it
tomorrow
uh how we can
how we can identify minor cracks in
these structures
so damage detection will will be doing
tomorrow
uh we have a question related to trivium
software can we
use the software for drone images no at
this moment we have not developed it for
drone
but we will update it for drone
at this moment it is only a thriving was
developed only for
terrestrial photogrammetric for images
okay what percentage of india's
archaeological sites have been preserved
through this technique
in india we are not preserving our
archaeological sites
using any uh advanced techniques
very few only very few studies only have
been
done and these are only studies
this is not in operational mode
how can we do 3d model virtual tour is
there any software map
there are when you create a 3d model
in the same software you can create the
virtual tour also
what is difference between tls point
cloud measurement
and ground based measurements now tls
point cloud measurement means you have
gone to the field you have collected the
tls point cloud
okay come back to your laboratory
and do the measurements on that
ground-based measurement means
i should be knowing before going to the
ground what exact measurements i have to
make okay and i have to do the
measurement on the actual
site itself okay whereas later on
when i do it on my tls model i can
do it sitting in my laboratory
okay so uh these are some of the
questions that we
have got i think all the questions we
have taken
okay these were the only questions
okay so thank you everyone for uh
joining in this session
tomorrow we will be having another
session and that would be focusing on
utilization of this tls point cloud
for digital documentation and
uh damage detection okay so do join for
that session also
so thank you all
you








Transcript
good afternoon
and welcome to this third session
on the short course on
archaeological and heritage studies
using geospatial technology
the third session will focus on use of
use of geospatial techniques
and methods for documentation and damage
detection
of built heritage in the previous two
sessions
we had an overview of all the technology
and methods
that were available and the second
session dealt with
ground based techniques particularly
focusing on
terrestrial laser scanner and close
range photogrammetry
another ground-based technique will be
dealt with in the next
coming session on microwave
microwave data analysis for heritage
studies and archaeological applications
their gpr
ground penetrating radar will be dealt
with
today we will look at how to use all
these techniques and methods
uh data acquire how to acquire data for
documentation and after documentation
how to do damage detection uh i am dr
hina pandey
i will be dealing with the first part
that is the digital documentation
and my colleague dr poonam estibari will
be following it up with
the damage detection section
now we've already gone through all this
introduction however just to summarize
again quickly we know now that cultural
heritage refers to the physical and
cultural assets
both tangible and non-tangible
such which have been passed on to us by
our previous generations these
historical structures are one of the
most
significant elements of cultural
heritage
therefore in this session we focus on
built heritage
so and these reflect history lifestyle
traditions of a country
and society at large cultural heritage
is
threatened by various factors
that is why documentation becomes so
important
and finally after documentation we can
do
damage assessment of this these built
heritage structures
so the various factors which threaten
cultural heritage or build heritage
specially are
natural hazards vandalism
anthropological activities like
development of cities
etc and natural aging
since these are all structures which
have been there for
a long period of time right from right
from the ancient times they have been
there so they have been exposed to the
elements
and due to natural aging they are
affected
and damaged the built heritage
refers to structures like monuments
so these have suffered significant
damage
and especially in a country like india
which has such diversity
and so many conditions prevailing
that it is majorly our large population
also
so this here it is majorly due to human
activity and population pressure
so anthropological activities become
very important in this
damage assessment part
so proper mapping damage detection and
digital documentation of these
cultural heritage sites or
archaeological assets
thus becomes very essential for their
preservation and protection
so approaches for comprehensive digital
documentation need to be
developed so that these cultural
heritage sites are properly monitored
and
managed now we can do this by employing
techniques and instruments
which are capable of providing
multi-dimensional information
in a quick and easy manner we discussed
these
methods and techniques
uh what data to use what techniques in
image processing etc and how to utilize
that
in the previous two sections with the
applications
of these data and techniques focusing on
documentation and on damage detection
these two sections will be discussed
today
now once a documentation has been done
this will enable
effective monitoring and conservation of
the monuments and heritage sites
a comprehensive documentation of a
structure
has to be able to unders it is done to
be
so that we are able to understand its
condition better
so data may be in the form of detailed
descriptions
or engineering drawings photographs 3d
models
or archival historical records we can
club all these together
use complementary information from each
and
in a synergistic manner we can do a very
comprehensive digital documentation
the added advantage it is an added
advantage if the documentation
is in the digital format so storage
analysis and dissemination of this
information becomes
infinitely easier as compared to the
classical forms of
or the traditional methods of
documentation in which we
only had hard copy paper
related documents so digitizing these
documents
will be helpful to us and will give us
an edge
in managing and monitoring the heritage
structures and science
now looking at all these points 3d
digital documentation
is and would be a very effective way of
monitoring structures
over a long period of time
so geospatial techniques and methods
play a very important role in this
documentation of heritage structures and
archaeological monuments
development of new sensors data
capturing technologies and methods
processing approaches all of these
together contribute
very significantly to the 3d
documentation
conservation and digital representation
or visualization of these
structures and sites methods that we can
use in recording and documentation of
the heritage buildings
since we are focusing mainly on built
heritage structures here
could range from surveying techniques
uh digital photogrammetry terrestrial
laser scanning
ground penetrating radar space born data
satellite data which could be from the
optical wavelengths it could be
hyperspectral data microwave data
thermal data and anything that suits us
for
the particular application data from uav
platforms etc
anything or club everything together
use complementary information from each
technique and use it in a synergistic
manner
combined format the state of art
approach for 3d documentation and
modeling of
large and complex sites use
and integrate multiple sensors and
technologies
so we could use photo inventory scanning
topographic surveying
uh spaceborne data microwave gpr data
etcetera
all together to do a very comprehensive
uh documentation documentation
of various aspects of the heritage site
integration of these technologies would
enable exploitation of the individual
techniques
and would also compensate on their
patients
so for example laser scanning is an
active technique and it
is range data so we only have point data
and not
image data automatically
so combining it with image related data
we could enhance the
limitation the the objectives of the
individual techniques capturing data at
different geometrical levels of detail
will also become possible and this can
be done with more accurate
precisely and a complete 3d geometrical
model
with interpretation and representation
can be achieved
multi-scale data through multiple
sensors
integration of these will provide the
best 3d
results the most comprehensive results
in terms of geometric detail and
visualization so a very complete and
augmented comprehensive
3d digital documentation would be
possible if the integration of all these
available technologies is
effectively done efficiently done
so just to recapitulate these are the
techniques and
remote sensing data that are available
the
passive sensors give us optical data in
optical wavelengths
or infrared wavelengths data could be
multispectral or hyperspectral
could be in the thermal wavelength the
active
sensors will give us microwave data
could have laser data
altimetric data the platforms on which
these sensors are installed could be
satellite based air based aircraft
aerial data
unmanned aerial vehicles that is uav
based or it could be ground-based data
we could also use multi-temporal data
for doing change analysis
so we could monitor the structure over a
period of time
at various dates and see how it has
changed
or how the anthropological activities
are affecting the
structure or what imprints these are
leaving on the
landscape around it so
the laser data both aerial or uav or
terrestrial laser data this can be used
to refine the spectral results
and the spectral information that we get
from
optical or multispectral and
hyperspectral data
by including surface morphology that is
the elevation information it gives us
very high
level of detailed information about the
height so this can be integrated and
either a digital elevation model which
includes all elevated surfaces
or a digital elevation model which has
only ground elevation
can be derived from this data also
taking the difference of pre-event
and correlating it and the pre and post
event correlation
the areas affected by the damage can be
identified we will show you examples of
these in the
forthcoming presentation
now i will begin with 3d digital
documentation
now the entire workflow has been
arranged in three parts documentation
damage assessment and then
reconstruction of the heritage sites
so uh first the in data acquisition
techniques
and integration of multi-source and
multi-platform data
to enable improved 3d documentation of
the heritage site
then in the documentation section
architectural primitives have been
extracted so some
sample primitives have been extracted
and put into a digital library
so that if you know these are broken or
if
they are lost then we can reconstruct
them based on these
these samples that are available in the
primitive library
and digital group linking of the
heritage sites has also been
attempted then in the next section
damage assessment using image processing
techniques
uh by using both point cloud data or
height data
and image data has been done and finally
once
the damage has been detected techniques
for reconstruction
or virtual reconstruction have been
proposed
so the entire procedural workflow
temptatively could be that you acquire
data
so here it could also have your data
earth observation data here
then preprocessing of the data is done
from both of these
3d point clouds are obtained image data
could also be obtained
and data is integrated so this forms a
very
crucial part of the workflow how to
integrate data from multiple sources
and to best possibly augment the final
3d model once the data has been
integrated and the 3d model has been
generated
you can extract architectural primitives
based on samples that are available
then damage detection and assessment
studies could be done
using the primitives a 3d blueprint
could be
generated for the heritage site or the
monument
reconstruction and virtual relocations
could be done
of artifacts of entire buildings etc
these were also showcased yesterday in
pre yesterday's
presentation and by combining all the
information together
with ancillary data or archival
information that we may have
a conjectural visualization may be done
to see
how it must have been in ancient times
when it was not damaged
so digital documentation
now i will begin with an example of a
unesco world heritage site in new delhi
this is the
kudu complex in delhi
so the entire complex has several
monuments
in various stages of
damage
so out of in the complex we worked on
these four
structures the kubatool islam mosque the
ali the bazaar
both imam zamin and the minar itself
so the terrestrial laser scanner was
used here
so the entire workflow was done
so an integration of the data was also
done point clouds were generated
with close range photographs and damage
was detected finally reconstruction was
done
so a workflow was developed to overcome
the various
challenges that we would face in the
data acquisition using terrestrial laser
scanner and crt
data that is close range photogrammetry
data
then data was processed so the
integrated data of
a framework had to be generated for
processing this data
and combining it together then
the alignment of the point clouds from
tls and
the photogrammetry images
so now you see since this is uh the
minar wasn't
high monument yes it had considerable
height
so the laser scanner gave us very dense
point cloud in the lower parts
but was not so successful in giving us
data there were lots of gaps in the
higher stories the top stories
so lots of gap in the laser scanning
data even though the instrument is
capable of giving us very dense point
cloud
so missing point clouds loss of details
and
very improper textures were here so this
was a challenge
now this was overcome so angular shape
the other
aspects were that the angular shapes of
the
structure so if you put the scanner may
be here very proper field planning had
to be done so a very
detailed field planning has been done as
to where and how and how many
places the scanner has to be put so that
appropriate
overlap between scans is properly done
and there are also complex patterns here
so which obstruct the views it's not a
simple structure
so all these aspects formed very
you know limitations as to how we had to
plan the field
right so this was the field planning
for the tls scan now if you see
the lower portions
have very detailed dense this is not an
image please note
it is only the point cloud from the
laser scan
so the lower portion is quite proper
however the upper stories
have considerable gaps now this was
compensated by
using photographs from the close range
photography
grammar technique so these were done
from a near range and from a far
range again the proper field planning
had to be done
because near range photograph did not
cover the full extent of the miner
and the photographs from the far range
could not cover major parts of the lower
portion due to obstructions because
there were trees and other monuments in
the
line of sight so to avoid occlusions the
camera stations had to be placed far
away
now if multiple images are stitched then
distortions were
observed so all these challenges had to
be addressed
and one had to take care of this so that
the augmented 3d model could be
generated so
after uh proper field planning we were
able to see that the
we were able to analyze that certain
locations would be
done from a far range and the detailed
photographs had to be for detailed 3d
models the the detail
to be extracted had to be done from a
near range
now here are the results of the
integration of the crp
data and the laser scanner data
these are this is the far range near
range images these are two image
related models and this is the laser
scan
now after integration of all the three
data types we you are now able to see
that the integrated 3d models gives us a
comprehensive detailed
model with enough point density
to see even the after documentation of
this we would be able to extract even
the minded
minute cracks or broken parts etcetera
as we will show you
in the next section so if you see here
look at the gaps that are there
right now after integration
all the gaps have been filled up
and we see a detailed structure so these
were
similarly we have done it for other
sites as well
after the 3d model has been generated
architectural elements can be extracted
so here what you do is we work with a
sample that is available to us
right now with historical data and
document from literature
one was able to identify the types of
arches in that period
of the sultanate period and if you see
one you you will be able to see which
kind of arch
would be most suitable so by studying
the angles and other things
one was able to do we made architectural
elements for
arches and for domes so
the primitive formation was done then
shapes were fitted
and dimensions were estimated for
these two structures
so it was decided that this
sample arch would fit the structures
that we had at hand
most appropriately
so a fitting algorithm was developed and
shapes were extracted
and then dimensions were estimated so
all these were taken as samples these
were data collected from the field
and this was the data from the
literature
so this algorithm was built up from the
tls point clouds horizontal sections
were taken
each small detail was fit in with
vertical primitives and horizontal
primitives and then they were integrated
along the cross section
then radius length etc was calculated
and a shape
simplified shape fitting same algorithm
was done
and then dimensions were estimated
similarly a similar approach was done
for
dome like structures so again from
literature
sample structures were identified
the type of dome which most nearly
fitted
the structure in the site was identified
and a similar approach
so this this is this type of dome this
one is this stone
right and then again
coordinate structural geometry was
fitted
they were sliced cross sections were
extracted at regular increments along
the z axis
and at regular angles radially
primitives were formed along each cross
sections as you can see
both this way and this way
and then a simplified shape denoting the
hemisphere was obtained
and it was then refined to fit
the exact structure
precisely
now you see the this is the point flow
so this is the inner view and after that
measurements were taken so that to see
how
uh properly had it been extracted so
the radius and the circumference
etcetera were calculated and
validated with field measurements and
also compared with
data in literature from the published
data by asi
and other authentic historical sources
so these primitives then can be used for
further analysis or can be kept in a
digital library and
then used later for reconstruction
damage assessment
or uh
then the next part of the documentation
would be
digital blueprinting so after these
primitives have been extracted
they can be used for digital
blueprinting now
printing here would be very important
because they would form
detailed maps of the entire heritage
structures or the heritage complex
because such for such ancient monuments
these maps would not be available unlike
recent structures like bridges and
other buildings in case of damage we
would be able to use this digital data
for our digital blueprint for damage
reconstruction etc so as you can see
each
small the the entire structure is
divided into small parts
each primitive and each element is then
extracted by image processing methods
so edge extraction has been done here to
get the first primitive
for different kinds of structure so you
can see that even the very detailed
carvings
on the tomb have been we have been able
to extract them with
the high resolution laser scanner data
combined with
high resolution images and applying
image processing
techniques to them so the edited
and refined shape primitive would be
like this
and with that the dome was extracted
separately
and then the jalis were extracted
the patterns of the jali and
on the parapet different types of
carvings are there
the top spire of the
dome pillars etc
they have all been done separately first
primitives were extracted like
the example shown in the previous slide
and then they were all done individually
later combined this is the point cloud
the interior was also mapped similarly
and this is the
exterior so this is the front elevation
with
very very precise measurements also
available so if on this model we make
measurements we will be able to
get very precise measurements very
accurate
measurements so the final integrated
blueprint of
this tomb of imams are mean in the gutu
complex area
similarly digital blueprints were
generated for kutum the first floor
and the front gate here this is the gate
which has been blue printed here small
parts
just to show you that each carving can
also be done
and carvings on the front and gated so
just to highlight that even very small
minute portions can be
very precisely extracted digitally and
archived
in the digital format this is another
example
of different study area which we began
as a case study
this is a church of the british period
in ukrachan and again similar method
methodology was applied
for the interior and exterior scans were
taken photographs were taken
data was integrated and detailed floor
plans
front elevation the back elevation
the left view has been taken and in
detail
uh the blue printing has been done with
very precise
measurements that can also be taken and
these are digital
prints maps so that they can be used
modified
or used for planning and monitoring
purposes
similarly and another approach was
applied for
a slightly different approach was done
for
multiscale hierarchical documentation
now here
the data was
unrolled the point cloud was unrolled
and then
rescaled to different pixel sizes
and at each pixel size it was stored
in the archive as hierarchical data set
so the
the purpose of this was that if it was a
big
damage that is a large crack a major
crack
this could be used at a certain scale
and if the data if the crack or the
damage was very minute
then only a small tile would have to be
used so one need not display the entire
data
instead of that one could use only that
particular tile which had the damage
and the user could
process data for that section only
so a database which was hierarchical and
multiscale
as you can see at different scales was
generated
so that one need not
open and process the entire big data
each time one had to do some processing
now
we will take a two minute gap
and then my colleague will dr poonam
up the section on damage detection and
reconstruction
a very quick gap and then we will
meet again
in this session and in this session we
will be discussing
damage detection and reconstruction
so as you have been told earlier earlier
also that using the ground-based systems
we were able to generate
the 3d models and these uh
3d models with dense point cloud
can be used for damage detection and
reconstruction
now in heritage
structures we encounter damages because
of various reasons and various type of
damages are encountered
so as you can see that there are there
can be various types of
structural damages in the cultural
heritage and basically what we are
dealing with
is built monuments is the buildings the
monuments in the heritage
so in the uh there can be
broken patterns because as you already
know that
in a monument in a heritage
structure generally there are repeated
patterns
and those patterns the in the carvings
the
features on the monuments they can be
broken because of several reasons
there can be some cracks minor as well
as
major which have developed in the
monument
buildings because of the failure of
building material
you can have certain issues certain
problems can be there
then out of plum walls if you remember
in yesterday's session i have discussed
about
the tilting of and
how using this three-dimensional model
we were able to
measure the amount of tilt in
the monuments can also show
discoloration
vegetative growth and vandalism etc
so these are few of the damages which
can be observed
in the building heritage so what we
have studied here is the broken patterns
and cracks these were the two major
damages that are encountered nearly in
most of the
monuments so we uh
try to develop a methodology using which
automata in a semi-automated method the
broken patterns
and cracks can be identified and once
the broken pattern are identified
we have also developed the methodology
using which
the broken pattern can be virtually
reconstructed also okay so
we will talk about this
so for uh for this broken pattern
for detecting the missing patterns we
have utilized the fractals
fractal dimensions now fractal
dimensions are
a feature of image processing or a
feature of image processing
which appear at the same which appears
same at different scale
so if you uh visualize them at a smaller
scale then also the feature is same
the shape is same when you
zoom it then also the feature is same
so this fractals exhibit similar pattern
at its
increasingly smaller scales and this
property is also called as
self similarity also known as unfolding
similarity or expanding similarity
so ah if you i'll give you a very
very uh simple example if you look at
the coast
line okay so if you look at
a coastline from a very uh from a very
so
for a very small scale map then also the
coastline has a zigzag pattern when you
zoom in
into that coastline at a regional level
then also it shows similar type of
pattern
you further zoom it you again see
similar type of pattern
so uh these natural features they
exhibit
a lot of self similarity similar thing
is there in the
trees also so a tree canopy
a lot of leaves are there you just go
zooming and zooming in and you go on
seeing the
similar pattern so that fracta
that quality of
the images that quality has been
utilized for
uh detecting these uh missing patterns
so as you must be aware that in the
patterns
then when the patterns are created in a
monument be it the
the patterns carving patterns or
designs anything so there is a
similarity
so same pattern there is an elemental
pattern and that elemental pattern
is repeated at a regular interval so
that
entire pattern entire structure is
generated
the same thing you must have seen in the
previous um
session when we were when our colleague
was discussing about extraction of
architectural primitives
and once that architectural primitive
has been extracted
that architectural primitive was copied
at different scales so as to complete
the entire structure
so the similar thing has been done here
what we have done
is we have extracted the fractal
dimensions of sample and convolution
window
so i will show you
this so this was the pattern
and you can see uh the upper layer in
the upper layer
the carving is complete whereas in the
lower layer
two of them is com are complete and two
of them are
broken so like this ah throughout the
monuments we were finding a lot of such
type of broken patterns
so what was done is we have identified
the
ah smallest element that can be
uh the elementary part so
and that for that elementary part the
fractal dimensions
were calculated now this these fractal
dimensions were calculated using a
convolution window
convolution window is one which
takes a small area of the image does
some operation
then moves ahead does the same operation
on the second area of the image moves
ahead
you can see here that is the black
square window
okay so using that convolution window
the similar win patterns were identified
and the potential sides were detected
which could be used as
the element so once these elements were
elemental area
so once this elemental area was
identified the fractal dimension of
the elemental area was calculated
for all the elemental areas throughout
the image were calculated
and these fractal dimensions were
compared with each other
this comparison of fractal dimensions
led
us to detection of sides which were
broken or in which the patterns was
missing okay so as you can see here
so windows with similar patterns were
identified so these are the windows with
similar patterns
using the convolution method and
potential sides the fractal dimensions
were
compared and the potential sides
were identified okay
and how these fractal dimensions were
compared there are various parameters of
these fractions
fractal dimensions i am not going into
the details of these
dimensions so as you can see there is
a marked difference in the values of
capital m small m and mu so
therefore the areas in which the pattern
is similar the values would be similar
whereas wherever the values are
different
the pattern would be missing okay so
finding the anomalous values we would we
had tried to find out
what are the broken areas
okay similar thing was done here also as
you can see
the this was the input image and
the elemental pattern that i was
discussing so this was the
elemental pattern okay so using that
elemental pattern the subsets were
created
and fractal analysis was done now
fractal analysis
was done and the comparison of fractal
dimensions parameters of fractal
dimension was
carried out and if the
if the change in if there is a change in
fractal dimensions we say that the
area is damaged and if it is not if the
fractal dimensions are similar we say
that the area is
not damaged so you can see they damaged
the class classified result showed us
what areas are damaged
and yellow depicts what areas are
not damaged once this we have identified
that these areas are damaged so
virtually what was done is the damaged
part
the of the image was removed from here
and this damaged part was replaced by
an undamaged pattern
that we have taken as elemental patterns
so elemental pattern was
replicated everywhere everywhere where
the
classification shows that it is damaged
so a virtually reconstructed area was
image was created okay
similarly here also you can see
this was the full pattern okay the
pattern of flower we have selected that
this is a complete pattern
and that pattern was the fractal
analysis
for the complete pattern was ch was
carried out
fractal dimensions were checked and the
classification was done what all areas
are
um they're damaged or not damaged the
damaged areas were removed from
the original image and they were
replaced by the
uh by the elemental area
okay so as the virtually reconstructed
image was
created okay
here what we have done is in the
previous one um
the same pattern is there but the
elemental area was the complete
flower now because the uh there is a lot
of symmetry in the
in the
in the pattern so what we have done is
we have
identified we have taken ah one fourth
of that
area and tried to rotate it and find out
what all
areas are damaged and undamaged because
what we have observed is that the in
some part
especially in the third damaged area the
entire area was not damaged only
a very small portion was damaged so
by two change the entire area so
small elemental area was was taken
so that also can be done
now that was about how we can identify
the broken pattern
then uh what we have observed is that
uh if there are changes in material
because
in one of the site in the church that i
have shown you yesterday
yesterday which was built somewhere in
1895 so there were
not many cracks as you can see in the
second image
this is an optical image lot of cracks
are visible and
what during the restoration work what
they have done they have
filled up those cracks with some
material so that
so as to give it a structural strength
but this material is different from the
original material that was
used for construction of the church
construction of the building
so this change of material we
never expected it but it was picked up
by the tls point cloud so as you can see
here this change of material
is has been picked up by ah
picked up by the terrestrial laser
scanner so we were able to identify the
areas in which
the
and the material is different from the
original material
so that also is one thing that can be
taken up using
telstra laser scanner data
also as you can see here
this is the broken uh part broken part
also was
was being picked up by terrestrial laser
scanner and later on
i will show you how we can reconstruct
this broken part
using the intact part
in different area okay
now um to identify the cracks of any
dimensions
um be it smaller cracks minor cracks or
major cracks what we have done is we
have tried to use the
um the intensity image as well as the
um depth and the
range data also so rgb image that is the
normal photograph
and the depth data from the terrestrial
laser scanning
we were able to generate this depth data
as i was
discussing yesterday that these teres
tls
laser beams are very minute they are
very
small and they can penetrate they can
go inside the clock and from there also
some return is coming back to us
so what we are able to get is from the
crack
for that crack area the depth of the
points is more than
ah when the point is coming from the
surface the depth is less when it is
coming
from inside the crack the depth is more
so
the what we tried to do is we used the
rgb image that is normal photograph
and we did uh track detection using
automated methods this these are all
automated methods
so we did crack detection only using the
photograph what we found is that
uh the crack was getting uh identified
was
getting detected but along with the
crack not many other features because uh
were also getting uh
highlighted because what is happening in
the build in the
monument there are various carvings
there are various
patterns written over there there's some
scriptures also written over there so
not many things are there
so only the photograph cannot
be used for automated craft detection so
what we did was
we utilized the photograph as well as
depth information
so when we combined both of them and
then did the crack detection so only the
crack
part was getting highlighted and
automatically this was
all was done automatically so
this was how the cracks can be
identified similar study was done
for uh clock tower indira boon also so
you can see this is rgb data
this is depth data and the crack portion
was
identified okay suppose
there is um a damage has happened in
an area and because of
that damage some part has broken
something has happened so if you have
the pre
damage and post damage uh data then
by comparing the pre damage and post
damage data you
can detect the broken portion also
ah if you remember i have shown you in
the
so there was one option for registration
of different point cloud so
you can co register point clouds of two
different dates one pre
damage
okay similar thing was done here you can
see very minute crack was there in
so that crack also we were able to
identify using the
image processing methods okay
so again this uh the same methodology
applied on
a different uh area and this we have
applied on different areas so as to
check whether the methodology is
is valid or can be applied for different
areas or not
okay so the broken part also can be
identified by comparing the pre-damage
and post damage data as i have shown you
for one railing
and this again is for one for
another area okay so you can see this
part was damaged
and the damaged portion was identified
so automatically you can understand you
can find out
how much damage is there in the monument
so
you need not go and zoom into each and
every part of the monument and check it
so you run the algorithm and it will
identify where
are the damages where are the cracks
where are the broken portions so all
those can be
done so as i have told you
by yesterday that virtual reconstruction
of the
statues we have done relocation of the
statues were done
so similarly in some portions in some
monuments what was observed that
the some part is damaged
whereas on the other side because of the
symmetry
the actual design is there and that
actual
design is intact so when we have this
intact design so using that intact
design we can
remove the damaged section and
reconstruct it from the
intact area from the actual area okay so
you can see
the reconstruction was carried out
using the adjoining area
so we cannot i just want to highlight
here that we cannot fix
any one methodology for all these
structures for all the areas
as and when the requirement is there you
can change the methodology slightly so
that it fits into your area
and deals with the problem that you are
having in your
area of interest as you can see here
this was a
statue in which one part was
intact and the other part was broken so
what we have done is
virtually we have removed this broken
part
taken the intact part from the other
side
created a mirror replica
mirror image and then attached it here
integrated it and this all was for
virtual reconstruction so these all
are virtually done so later on
once virtually they are done you can
later on if you want to
do the restoration work that also can be
done now
previous uh discussion was regarding how
the ground-based systems
especially tls and can be used for
damage detection the damage detection
can also be
done using the satellite and uav data
because uh if you want to do a damage
detection in a larger area
or instantaneous damage detection you
want to do
just after the calamity has happened
then
the satellite images the uav data can be
very very helpful so if you remember
there was a very
very uh big earthquake
in kathmandu uh
in 2015 so
and that happened and um the entire
area of the
the entire
area was means lot of buildings were
destruct or damaged in that particular
earthquake so as you can see here the
first
image
the first image is the intact image uh
when the pre-disaster image pre
earthquake image
are taken on october 25th uh
2014 and later on after the earthquake
has happened on april
2015 the image has been captured
and you can see that these
structures the tower
this all area has been damaged you can
see in the second image also
i have highlighted it uh use with the
yellow circles you can see the vasala
durga temple
that all got damaged
so this plaza in front of royal palace
of bhaktipur kingdom it is also a unesco
world heritage site
so some study we have done using only
the satellite images
how this is bharara tower which also got
collapsed
only the base got means the earthquake
was very
extensive 7.8 was the magnitude
so what we did was we utilized these
satellite images and applied
the image processing operations because
when
what happens when in case of such
disaster such as
earthquake the time is of utmost
important you want to know
exactly where the damage has happened
you don't have
time for
for visualization of the image means
you don't have that much time so what
can be done is because
because of this international charter
gets activated the
data is freely available data for the
disaster site is freely available to
everyone to all the
um especially to the country that is
affected
so ah once that data is available
with us within the i think a few hours
the data gets available
so once the data is available what we
can do is
we can apply automated image processing
methods and find out where exactly the
major damage has happened once we have
identified that
we can concentrate our residue
operations into that area so even though
such type of
methodology that is developed that can
be useful for
heritage monuments that can also be used
for
disaster mitigation and rapid disaster
rather damage assessment okay so as you
can see here we have
utilized the image textures for
earthquake
related damage assessment and please
just for your information applying these
texture measures
calculating glcm parameters it is just
by
a click of button in the image
processing software so once you
put the image click on that you can
generate these
texture measures dlcm parameters so as
you can see here
this was uh the first image if you see
this was the pre-disaster and this is
the post-disaster image
in the pre-disaster these this building
has a sloping roof so the
boundary of the roof is clearly seen
whereas in the post disaster the entire
boundary everything
is gone so if you have such type of data
just by simple comparison you can
the software itself will tell you that
these are the areas which have
changed and you can um focus your
relief work in such areas so there are
other
uh glc cm parameters
which can be used for damage assessment
okay so there are various applications
out there now
here you can see that was done using
texture parameters we can also use rgb
ihs
transforms to find out what are the
areas which got damaged so as you can
see here this is this was pre-event
uh saturation intensity hue and
saturation
rgb we have converted into intensity
and saturation and saturation for
pre-event and posting
even so in the post even saturation
image you see that
all the buildings that got damaged they
were getting highlighted
okay because ihs model preserves color
irrespective of the intensity
similar study was done um
for rapid damage assessment in uh
bagan area of myanmar okay
in a violent earthquake measuring 6.8
hit the central
myanmar on 24th august 2016 and
because of this earthquake
the 14th century archaeological site of
bagan
got severely damaged and as you can see
i have shown you a ground photograph of
a pagoda so not many pagodas pagodas are
uh but this site of
buddhist temples you can say okay so
and these were 14th century pagodas
so and that entire area this bhagavan
area is full of such type of
pagodas so this sulawani pagoda
was one very big pagoda which got
damaged in this particular
um earthquake as you can see here the
ground photograph shows that the entire
front portion of this
got damaged so what we have done
is we try to develop methods for damage
assessment
and we utilize pre and post date data
also what we after the disaster has
happened the uav flight was
taken up in the damaged area
to assess the damage so we had that
uav data also grown data and we tried to
process and
develop methodology on that data also
now later on i will be discussing uh the
uav data
but at this moment what i would like to
show you is that
in the in the
in the damage post even data you can see
that half of the portion is going in the
shadow area so in the satellite image
now
that particular area the shadow portion
is um means the whatever damage has
happened we cannot
be sure about that just by using the
satellite image
so other methods are also there so
just a very simple method what we have
done was
because time was very important in that
sense so what we have done once we
receive the data
we have created just a
line transfers line transact line from
one point to another point
the and we have seen how the pixel
values are changing
okay in the pre event and post event you
can see a marked difference because in
post event because
lot of material has gone down as rubble
so the reflectance has increased
when the reflectance has increased you
can see
the the pixel values they show
a very haphazard manner ok
so you can identify in one instance that
what where all the damage has happened
similarly we can carry out
the classification and change detection
so object is analysis and change
detection was carried out
so as to find out how much damage has
happened
we also utilize the glcm texture
parameters
utilizing our knowledge from nepal
earthquake
time so we use that knowledge and we
apply
the glcm textures first order and second
order and try to find out how much
damage is there so we found that these
textures
glc and textures are very very useful
for detecting damage on a larger
on larger area the finer
damages such as cracks and broken
patterns for such type of damages
the ground based instruments were
required
so again you can see we have also used
fractals
for this and variograms also
okay so all the image processing
operations we have used and we have
utilized and
tried to find out using which
which application using which
algorithm we are able to get better
results
okay so these are variogram results of
variogram
and it is also able to show us the
where the damage area in both the
regions both
in the shadow area as well as
in sunlit area
you can see this was the shadow area in
the shadow area
also variogram is able to give us the
data the information
for the same area we have used the
satellite image also as you can see this
was
the first image is uh satellite ortho
image
so as i have already discussed that some
part of the building some part of the
monument is going in the
shadow part whereas when we use the uav
image
we don't have such issues and the entire
area
is is visible to
us for and for analysis okay
so they sat in the satellite image the
damages were detected and in the
uav image the damages were detected so
we found marked improvement
in uav image okay because uav mounted
sensor was a multi-directional view
and it enabled clear visualization of
damage and
debris so this was
the photorealistic 3d model using
um using uav data okay
you can see this is the uav data the
damaged points were classified
and these are the damaged you can see
this
all in the 3d point cloud you can see
this all
is the damaged area okay
this is the damaged area
so this is all from my side after
five minutes break we will take up the
questions
whatever questions you have you can
post it in the chat box thank you
welcome in the question answer session
so we have
many questions from you all and
just by looking at your questions i can
see that
you all are working in the archaeology
archaeological domain so priyanka
prakash
wants to ask that can we do
reconstruction of prehistoric site or
settlement by
3d documentation now priyanka first of
all documentation documentation means
when
whatever is existing you want to
document it okay so document is
making a note or making a
digital library or something of that
sort
of whatever is available okay in a 3d
form
so once means if
it is even in a prehistoric site
prehistoric site if
the things are not available we cannot
do the documentation
and reconstruction of prehistoric site
then again is a very vague thing
a lot of information from ancillary data
has to be
incorporated then only we can do
reconstruction of that area okay and
that also would be only our
visualization okay we are not very sure
whether
the same thing was there or not okay
then ashirawad verma is
asking what type of problems
archaeologists suffer while working at
rani ki wow
because that is very damaged well
heritage what technologies we are using
to reconstruct rani kiba
okay now i think you are asking about
the step when the step wells
are have means
when you go down the area is very less
so
in setting up any instrument and
taking the data in that area becomes
difficult
secondly you cannot get the proper
sunlight in that area
so that is one issue and uh
the we at iaers we are only developing
the methodologies
so uh the conservation of the heritage
is um is under uh
survey of india so they must be taking
necessary steps for doing the
reconstruction and
conservation
okay shashank kumar wants to
ask which tools are used to identify
cracks through
automation mainly image processing
methods are being used for
identification of cracks
automatically okay what gadget is used
to take radiography of built heritage we
have not taken radiography we have taken
the terrestrial laser scanning data
okay
there are other technologies also which
can be used
so how time it takes how much time it
takes to get the data processed
for mitigation so it depends on
the amount of data
that is there but
for one satellite image i don't think it
takes a lot of time
and in for disaster mitigation
the time is very very time is life in
fact
if we say so once you get the data
you can simply process it within 5-10
minutes
okay but once that data is processed you
have to look into the area to find out
the anomalies
i wish to use the the
damage detection techniques for
ecological afforestration programs to
detect
if trees that were planted have been
vandalized
what is the open source software and
data that i can use
the data is not available in
for such type of things you can go for
um
because for identification of vandalized
trees you require a very high resolution
data so such high resolution data
open source is not available okay
and once you have the data you can
there are not many image processing
softwares that can be
used okay then what is the ultimate aim
of getting this heritage data
other than damage detection so damage
detection
is one thing then we have told you about
the
3d blueprinting or digital documentation
of the monuments
then we have told you about virtual
tourism
then we have told you about site
specific issues such as
thrifting of kotominar uh in
uh children of kotominar was there then
relocation of statues in nalanda area
was there
so so many other applications are there
which can
the data can be used for so many other
archaeological studies
how artificial intelligence technology
has helped us in retrieving and
reconstructing 3d structures digitally
so artificial intelligence
is very very helpful and
but we have not used here
artificial intelligence and artificial
intelligence mainly is used for
data classification data
feature extraction from the data it is
not
currently being used in uh 3d structures
in reconstruction of 3d structures
at least not by us
okay even after having such a great
detection tool why many monuments are
not reconstructed
at the faulty point we are there as
as academicians we are there to develop
the methodologies it is up to the
authorities to take up these data sets
and these methodologies
and work on them
that does it detects the lanes of
taj mahal due to acid rain yes
due to acid rain whatever discoloration
is there in taj mahal it can be
detected using image processing methods
which software is used for blue printing
and texture analysis for texture
analysis
any uh any image processing software can
be used
and for blue printing and testing laser
scanner
data processing the softwares
received along with the terrestrial
laser scanners were
used can we use the damage detection
method for steel structure
yes and reinforced concrete structure
also yes there are lot many
uh studies if you search on where you
will find lot many
studies are there in which the building
crack
assessment or crack detection structural
analysis of
the dam and all those things are done so
that also
are there the methods are same the
building can be either
your house or it can be the monument
can we deceive damage under land
through satellite under land what type
of damage are the means i can't
understand
and if we can then we are we able to
know that the earthquake is coming
no only some presumptions are done and
there are certain indicators
for earthquakes
how can we detect the damage detection
in minimum time using terrestrial laser
scanners so
we are developing on the same
methodologies so these
automated methods for damage detection
using tns so
it is it
we are doing that only in case of
kuthuminar where all the pictures were
collected through ground-based camera
only or
some uav was also used no uav was not
taken
only ground-based cameras and
terrestrial laser scanning was done
okay how damage detection is done in the
same way can we make a 3d image of
location of things such as cars
yes definitely so
i think last year we have done a course
on 3d modeling
uh terrestrial photogrammetry so
in that we have explained in detail how
terrestrial photogrammetry can be used
for
creating 3d models of cars for
accident sites and so on okay so
it can be very easily done and it is
being done
in many places for knowing uh
for investigation also for the accident
and for the crime scene
so many things are being done using
terrestrial photography
so i think these were the questions so
further if you have any doubts you can
write to us on our email ids we have
given the email ids in the
in the presentation and thank you all
for joining in this session
so now i sign off thank you all
thank you one and all
you







Transcript
[Music]
uh
foreign
good afternoon everyone and welcome in
this fifth
session of the course on geospatial
technologies for
archaeological applications today we
have with us
dr mb rajni dr rajni conducted
doctoral research at national institute
of advanced studies bangalore
and was awarded phd by the university of
maisour
she taught at niit university nimrana
and was a fellow of nalanda university
she was also the guest faculty of iit
gandhinagar
she has joined niya's as a faculty
member in 2015.
dr rajni's research has two interrelated
facets
number one is analyzing cultural
landscapes using geospatial data
to identify new features of
archaeological
interests and advancing the usage of
such analysis for
preserving built heritage in the face of
rapidly growing infrastructural
development
and urbanization so
today she will be giving us a talk on
her recent
book that is patterns in past
settlements geospatial analysis of
imprints of cultural heritage on
landscape
so now i invite dr mb rajni from
niya's to deliver her talk
dr rajni
thank you dr poonam i hope i am audible
am i audible yes uh dr rajdi you are
audible
thank you okay okay then i'll start
thank you very much for this wonderful
opportunity
uh it's very nice to be here and i'm
really thrilled that you have a course
on archaeology
and that there is a good participation
for it
um i look forward to interacting with
all of you
for participating here so this is a book
that i have spent a lot of
several years planning and writing and
it's finally out
just a few months back uh this book was
planned
in order to sort of um uh
try and help people who are studying
cultural heritage
uh conservation of heritage archaeology
how they can go about using
remote sensing and gis so with this i
will start
about my book so with or without
our consent details from our daily lives
are being captured and stored in masked
digital databases
if humanity were to vanish tomorrow and
alien historians
chanced upon these databases
centuries from now they would have
incredibly rich resources for studying
humanity's past
as humans in the 21st century trying to
understand
our own past we have no comparably
detailed database to tap into instead we
must scavenge for traces
of past human activities that have
survived from material
form and develop expertise in
interrogating these material
before their secrets fade into oblivion
we rely on archaeologists to scrutinize
ancient material
once again my slide is not moving i'm
just checking
yeah we uh rely on archaeologists to
scrutinize ancient material
ranging from small scale fragments of
poetry
and bricks to large-scale artifacts such
as individual buildings
and a whole landscape or settlement in
each of these domains scholars have
benefited from scientific developments
that are constantly expanding the kind
of ancient
material that are interrogable and
technological advances that
enhance our ability to extract useful
information from them
this book is an introduction to a branch
of archaeology
that scrutinizes landscapes
such as this for instance at nalanda
humans
necessarily scar the landscape when they
construct
structures forts canals
tanks and road networks these scars
which can survive for many centuries are
also material records
of past human activities and are
therefore worthy of
study however these cars are difficult
to discern at ground level
and their value was largely unrecognized
until
they were observed from aerial
perspective initially from aircrafts and
more recently from satellites
lieutenant colonel beasley a sapper of
the royal engineers in mesopotamia
during the first world war spotted
distinct lines as you can see in the
center of this photo
black and white photograph there is a
rectangular pattern
that is very different in orientation
from the
surrounding patterns so he spotted
distinct outlines of an ancient canal
in the course of his repeated flights
over the tigris and euphrates plain
enemy territory at the time while
carrying out a survey of contested area
beyond
baghdad he wrote the remains of an
ancient city were disclosed
which would not have otherwise have been
discovered in all
probability it was the old samara
a more recent example here is a false
color
image of bangalore and here is a
map of bangalore from
made in 1791 this map
shows a four cornered settlement and an
oval citation
on its south if you carefully analyze
the satellite image
we can identify where exactly was the
old settlement
i now request you to carefully look at
the point
i'm highlighting
though it's fully overgrown but still
the imprints or the traces of the
patterns
are still discernible we can still see
this
pattern of the old settlement apart from
such
images analysis analysts can put
together spatial data from
other sources including old maps
here for instance there is a map of
the portuguese town of kohilan
or um what is known as column today
made in 18 1630 here is another map
of the same location made in 1635
here is a third map the first two maps
were made by portuguese and the third
one made by
dutch uh which looks very different it
might be very difficult for you
for the viewer to even believe it is the
same place
uh this third map made in 80 1687
then there are drawings made by
people who visited some artists to show
how the scene looked and so on
but what's interesting if we carefully
examine we can identify the common
buildings
and also we can identify the currently
protected
um piece of wall we belong
actually to this very building because
that's the only building which had
three stories and the remains of the
of this fort fortress which is
right now protected also has three
stories now we can also identify on
satellite images
uh which part of column belonged
to dutch and which part belong to
portuguese by analyzing
these images
this coherent spatial view allows an
analyst to hunt for visual patterns in a
landscape in a manner
akin to an art historian examining a
painting through an appropriate
historical lens
furthermore just as a modern art
historian uses technology to scrutinize
what lies
beneath the topmost layer of paint
advances in technology of remote sensing
permits satellites to view landscape in
different wavelengths and
reveal hidden layers of human artefacts
i'm sure in the last few
uh last week you would have been
acquainted with such
technologies that is available with
remote sensing
so here i have shown an arrow to show
the location of this particular building
uh which remains and also it shows in
context
of what was the um dutch
fortification which is marked in yellow
and the portuguese fortification market
pink in this google earth imagery
the purpose of such analysis is to
identify and understand
conserve and protect remnants of our
past this field therefore brings
together knowledge from archaeology
history art history architectural
history
heritage science geo-archaeology
geomorphology remote sensing
geographic information system and
cultural heritage conservation and
management although i am not an expert
in all these domains my research group
has brought elements from each of these
domains to bear in
investigating landscapes surrounding
several archaeological sites so here is
a map
which shows all the sites that my book
touches in one way or another not all
sites we have done in a very great
detail
but we uh in in even if it is
mentioned or given as an example
this map shows the location of all those
cells
while all these sites are situated in
the indian subcontinent
my research has helped me recognize and
articulate universal principles that i
am
excited to present in this book i hope
this book will be of interest to
at least three groups of readers i will
elaborate on these groups of audiences
for my book after a brief
on the chapters the book has seven
chapters
chapter one is an introduction to the
field and should be of interest to all
readers
it begins with definition of cultural
heritage adopted from unesco's
definition
and highlighting that the primary focus
is on built heritage
these structures constitute the known
remnants of built heritage at the site
and it is possible that history unknown
remnants associated with the site
still exists in its vicinity
consider the vicinity of nalanda for
instance
when we visit the site protected by
archaeological survey of india
we see these sacred temple structures
called chaithyas there are six of them
and there are ten dwelling structures
monasteries called vihara each has a
central hall surrounded by monastic
cells
this infrared image shows the protected
site of nalanda
and the area immediately around it
notice how four temples in the protected
region lie at ir rely at regular
intervals along a straight
not south line sure enough the infrared
image
suggests the presence of one unexplored
mound to the south
and one to the north in the north one
can also see
two crop marks at exactly the intervals
we are expecting
so here the black or the gray dotted
line shows the protected area
and the within it are the protected
monuments but outside it shows
marks of location identified through
crop marks
which indicate places where there would
have been past
such monuments because they are fall
they fall in a
line with the existing ones and those
marks indicate
locations of old settlements
here is one more in the southern area
just to show what is its condition
at present the central thesis of this
book is that a careful study of a site's
vicinity
or special context i call the site's
vicinity in the book as special context
so context can lead to two important
types of discovery that
may improve our overall understanding of
the site and
inform our strategy for its protection
firstly the discovery of further
instances or attributes of built
heritage
and secondly the discovery of artifacts
such as former water bodies canals
mounds associated with past human
activity in the site so the
other things like water bodies canals
may not be direct indication but it is
definitely indirect indication
chapter 2 describes how landscapes
evolve
over time and discuss the implications
of this evolution
for the analyst seeking to identify
archaeological features from above
for instance the well-known
example of crop patterns in the field
first observed in aerial photos of world
war
one and two here you can see a circular
pattern in a field turned out to be
surface
impressions of buried fourth wall and
adjacent
mode so here is a diagram showing
how a fort wall and mode would have
existed at the
time of it was in use and here
it is showing how over time if there is
cultivation happening in that place how
a buried
moat and buried fort wall should would
show difference in
crop color but this is only one
of many ways a landscape
sorry landscape can morph itself which
depends on what has been happening
subsequently on the surface
so here is an example how there are many
different ways
a landscape can morph depending what's
happening there
even in an urban jungle like cities one
can see
traces of the past layout which are
inscribed as
roads or land use patterns a ruined
disused wall
becomes hindrance in mobility and people
and goods
move along it along it creating
paths which over time become roots and
remains as a permanent scar
even if land use on either side keep
changing
for instance let us take an example of
old delhi jama masjid and the red fort
known also as lal killa are easy to find
on google earth image
lal killer was the citadel of a much
larger fort encircling
jaanabad which no longer exists now
but can we still see its scars
let me cheat by overlaying the satellite
image
with this 19th century map of delhi
which shows the surrounding fort now
i hide the map
and suddenly you see where the fort lay
this is an example of how a site looks
in an urban area
similarly the manifestation of sites in
different kinds of land surfaces
are discussed in the second chapter with
examples
in the book we refer to the landscape
and the vicinity of the site
as its spatial context for a given site
we would like to identify features and
satellite images
of its spatial context that may provide
new archaeological insights
for that site when we look at a site
spatial context today
we see only the present point in its
evolutionary trajectory
for some sites we may have historical
spatial records that provide multiple
snapshots
of these special contacts as they change
over time
these records we did from few years ago
if we are using google earth images to a
few decades ago
if we are using older satellite image
images including corona images
corona has a different meaning today but
i mean corona satellite images
to a few centuries ago such as using of
old maps paintings and spatial
descriptions in historical text like the
column example
even with multiple snapshots of a site
our data is generally
too sparse to precisely infer the
sequence of gradual
changes to its spatial context this lack
of data forces
us to guess how the spatial context
evolved
and to use these guesses to explain why
we cannot
observe certain features images may
directly show certain
surface features well some subsurface
features may only be visible indirectly
through morphological extreme
expressions
for example here is a 19th century map
of lalcott and khilarai
then an image of 1965
this is a image from corona series of
satellite
then a recent image
in most cases recent image is what we
have
and we have to hypothesize the reverse
order
which is sometimes aided by bold images
maps
records thus this chapter 2 provides the
basis for answering critical questions
such
as what kind of features should i be
looking for
in satellite images and why can't i see
what i'm looking for
in a particular image for instance
so here is just to give an example how
we have to infer the reverse order
chapter 3 describes the various types of
imaging technologies that are
operational on contemporary and
retired earth observation satellites
this chapter helps the analyst answer
the question
is this type of satellite image likely
to be
useful for my analysis for instance
look at these images of landscape of
baylor in karnataka
the one on the left shows the circular
mote
you can see a red circular circular
shape red pattern
in the center of the image so the one on
the left shows the circular mote that
surrounded the old
settlement whereas the natural color
image on the right
though of higher resolution doesn't show
the circular pattern so clearly
the chapter also reveals some of the
science behind these technologies to
help answer the
inevitable follow-up question why and
why not
such as this diagram
showing how light of visible wavelength
versus infrared variants
is reflected of a leaf causing this
bright
vegetation pattern in infrared imagery
so as you can see the visible
wavelengths
are reflected off the top of the leaf
whereas the infrared
goes further deep and diffuses much more
and therefore we were able to see much
brighter or much more difference in good
good quality and not so good quality
vegetation or healthier
and less healthy vegetation in infrared
image
chapter 4 answers the question how is
gis
used for archaeological investigation in
short
gis enables overlaying multiple layers
and extracting information from them
our present presentation in this chapter
is deliberately limited to the
application
domain that is archaeology and at a
scale that covers the spatial context of
the site to avoid overwhelming readers
who are unfamiliar with gis with
complexities that a general introduction
to gis
must necessarily address here in this
figure is
just show how an old map of agra this is
the
bend of river jamuna at
agra uh so how um
overlaying geo-referencing and
overlaying multiple imageries
makes it easy for us to analyze the
changes
chapter five presents five case studies
so there are five
sites for which more detailed analysis
has been presented in the book
whereas there are many other sites which
we give as example of a particular kind
of
interpretation that we discuss so why
have we selected
five case well have i selected five case
studies is
to demonstrate that there is no fixed
answer to the question
how should i conduct geospatial analysis
for site
of interest that means i don't have one
equation or one formula to say
this is the way you have to do for any
sites in the country so there is no
one formula for that this chapter also
re-emphasizes
the core ideas presented in chapter 2 3
and 4 in more complex
settings in our experience there is no
fixed or formulaic approach to
geospatial analysis of archaeological
sites
because the process of analysis is
sensitive
to variation between the sites these
variations can be grouped into
five principal categories number one
variation in the features of interests
this will vary across
sites in terms of their scale their
architectural sites
for instance mobile sites have a
specific kinds of patterns
and buddhist sites can have a different
kind of patterns
so every site based on its cultural
background
will have a different pattern that is
visible number two
variations in the natural setting and
subsequent natural changes
sites vary in terms of that terrain
whether it's
in flat plains hills etc as well as
their exposure
to natural processes such as weathering
floods
etc number three anthropogenic changes
such as sites will vary in terms of
subsequent human
activities and their impacts sites may
be in cities
or sites maybe somewhere where a dam was
built or sites maybe somewhere
where harbor was built and so on
number four satellite imagery data from
satellites may be plentiful in some
sites but limited for others
this difference is very low i mean the
variation in this
might be the most low especially the
satellite imagery this may differ if it
is lidar and so on
number five historical spatial records
that is the quality and quantity of such
records may similarly vary across
sites some sites may be well studied
there may be excavation that have
happened there may
be many reports some sites may not have
so that
kind of background information also can
vary the purpose of this chapter is to
illustrate how the process of analysis
responds to this variation these
variations thus we have carefully chosen
five sites so that there are significant
variations across these sites in each of
these five categories
the five sites are
nalanda which of which i already spoke a
bit about
um what this figure shows is apart from
the um immediate surroundings features
in the immediate surrounding of the
protected area which i already discussed
uh we also were able to see a pattern of
water bodies in the
larger area plus a paleo channel that
connected these water bodies
to the nearest river so water was drawn
from the nearest river towards this
water body so this is one uh one of the
case studies
agra agra was the mughal capital as we
know and probably
most of us if not all of us have been at
least once in our life
to taj mahal here is a
map of agra made in 1720.
and this shows a layout of agra where
it had about 50 riverfront gardens you
can see the small
squares that surround both sides of the
river
and today what we have is a very few
compared to
this number of 50 50 gardens plus it
also had two
city walls so here is a result of our
analysis
in yellow we have marked number 20 is
taj mahal 28 is agar fort and
a few more which are protected locations
but we also have been able to identify
all these around 50 gardens that
actually were flanking the river
of course most of it is built over now
but there are some especially on the
inner curve
that are still sort of um in a
in a plantation mode and also we were
able to do geos
through a geospatial analysis identify
where the
fort was or the city walls existed
larabar palace garden at sri lanka the
famous one in south india is the
bangalore lala but
there was a namesake talas garden in
srirangapatna as well which was laid out
by tripus
and using old maps and satellite imagery
and also some
hints from ground some ruins which we
could see from ground and
hints from some uh old paintings we were
able to identify
where this lal bark palace garden was
and what was its layout
talakadu is the site that i worked
started working first
it is a site which is in the inner curve
of
river kaveri and it's a very unusual
site as there is a huge
point bar sand deposit that has got
accumulated burying the old settlement
and uh using satellite imagery we were
able to identify
the um canal which connected uh which
drew water from
the uh nearby dam to the settlement and
also
a wall um enclosure wall
and the an area which had uh
cultivation and also a reservoir so
these are the larger
layout patterns uh for this particular
site especially we were able to give
this input
to um a group from um
mysore university and karnataka state
archaeology department who were
excavating
this site and they were able to also
perform excavation on the
location that we identified and one
location that we identified
mahabalipuram uh is another very uh
unique site of course i have not given
the dates of each of this site
they are famous enough but we also try
to make it as
varied as possible though we haven't
really gone looking into prehistoric
sites so far
i hope i will be able to do uh in future
nalanda was active between 4th and 12th
century agra of course
much later 16th 17th 18th century
nalbagh
palace was active uh in 18th century
talakadu from 5th century onwards
and mahabalipuram 8th century onward so
in mahabalipuram we were able to use
a portal and chart or a maritime chart
which marks some monuments
and it marks a very different kind of
shoreline which
we used as a indicator to see where
these monuments that gave the site the
name seven pagodas
were stands because the popular
assumption
is that the seven out of the seven
monuments only one stands which is the
shore temple
remaining have got uh gone underwater
but actually what has happened is the
water has received
um receded and the actual seven pagodas
are standing further
inland
chapter 6 explores the question how can
geospatial analysis be used for
preserving conserving and managing
cultural heritage sites
it is titled site protection boundaries
a double-edged sword ah to demonstrate
that if one did not have protection
boundaries
for instance
here is an unprotected site affected
by widening of airport road in bangalore
can you see how it was in early 2000s
and how it has become
now so
boundaries are important if we don't
have boundaries this is what will happen
here is another example
an armory from tibu sultan's time
had to be removed spending crores
or had to be moved spending crows to
make way for doubling of
railway but see this is this is the
problem when there is no boundaries
set for protecting these sites because
because of the
premium on land and need for land for
other public and maybe private purposes
many
sites get destroyed or damaged or moved
in the interest of other reasons so when
we don't have set boundaries
again in this case the railway doubling
project was
taken up when the
the knowledge of this particular armory
was not there and then it was too late
to take
so when we don't have boundaries this
happens
but let me show you what happens when we
have boundaries
here is
but see what's what ha what having
boundaries can do look at the amount of
urbanization in the landscape of
both gaia from around the time it
attained world heritage tag
to now it arranged attained world
heritage tag in 2002
and look at the most uh it's not the
most recent image but recent enough to
see
the changes one wonders is recognition
really protecting the site
nalanda uh was one nalanda was tagged as
world heritage by unesco in 2016.
with a core and a buffer zone
core zone of 0.2 23 kilometer square and
buffer zone of point
50.58 kilometer square
but look at the expanse of its remains
one wonders will this landscape see the
same fate as both kaira
in the next two decades so chapter 6
examines some of the limitations of
current approaches and proposes gis
enabled alternatives that
address these limitations as we saw
putting boundaries is necessary
but we need to put adequate boundaries
if inadequate boundaries are put
then putting boundaries suggest that we
don't have control
outside this so development can happen
outside
so therefore it is very important to
consider all the
uh landscape remains that are there
before putting this boundary otherwise
the popularity of the site
like both will become the reason for its
destruction because once you put down
a smaller boundary there will be and it
becomes the site becomes world heritage
site there'll be lot of
demand for land in the vicinity to build
hotels
make wider roads and so on so its own
popularity can become
its um you know the site can become a
victim of its own popularity
so the last chapter finally chapter 7
provides an affirmative answer to the
question can geospatial analysis of
archaeological sites
contribute to research in other
disciplines
through three case studies the first one
archaeo astronomy demonstrated by
studying
orientation of sacred structures at
nalanda and other buddhist sites
so the the structures marked in red are
the sacred structures chaithyas
so our analysis as archaeoastronomical
analysis
have found that all these structures
which are actually facing east but not
exactly east it is slightly tilted we
are able to uh measure this tilt using
satellite image
and we are able to identify that they
are connected to some
astronomical phenomena rising of a
particular star which changes over time
and using that we
have tried also to date these structures
the second discipline is military
history here is an example where
we have used old maps and satellite
imagery this old map marks
a particular event in 1799
where the british several army of the
british as you can see there is bombay
army led by steward madras army led by
harris wellesley's army and so on
so where several where british attacked
sri patna and following this event
actually a few days later
sudan was killed it was around that time
so there is a map military map showing
uh
this these attacks and this was also a
famous attack because when british
attacked srirangapatna
tipu sultan's army had
made a counter-attack using tippu's
the famous mysorian rockets ortipus
rockets
and they were taken aback because the
british were taken aback because at that
time
they didn't know what was the range of
mysore
rockets they thought they had placed
their armies sufficiently
distant but the range of mysore rockets
was much higher
so using satellite imagery and old map
and geo-referencing them
we were able to identify where the
mysore army had their
um you know had stayed from where this
rockets were shot
and the where where the rockets landed
and therefore also
measure this um
range of the rockets so measuring range
of tipu sultan's rocket by analyzing
satellite images together with gold maps
and records
the third one coastal geomorphology
looking at old maritime chats for
studying cultural heritage also yielded
understanding how of how the course has
changed
so what happens with coastal maps in
general
most of the time they mark course but
they also marks
locations that were prominent in the
past which are now archaeological
sites so we can use these locations as
reference to
understand how the cost has changed
apart from these examples of
contributions to other research area
this last chapter also discusses future
direction for this body of research so i
refer to the three potential groups
that this book is aimed at earlier so
the three potential groups of readers i
refer to before
are
the first group comprises students and
budding or established researchers in
the field such as archaeology history
art history
who see potential value in analyzing the
landscape in their region
of interest readers in this group
typically have little or no exposure to
the fundamentals of remote sensing and
gis
and i hope that this book will flatten
the seemingly daunting learning curve
that they face i was once part of this
group
and i now recognize that my initial
hesitancy in adopting remote sensing gis
was rooted
in a cultivated fear of science and
technology
i was fortunate to have mentors to guide
me past this mental hurdle
i was also a student in iirs and
i hope that my book will similarly draw
curious minds
from this group into this fascinating
field of research by providing
them an accessible pathway
the second group of readers who i hope
to interest are authorities concerned
with protection of cultural heritage
readers from this group are part of
international
organizations such as unesco as well as
national and subnational agencies
in india these agencies include
archaeological survey of india and each
state's department of archaeology
their mandate includes defining property
boundaries for protection
protecting archaeological sites and
regulating
changes to land use in their vicinity
this book
aims to stimulate discussion among this
community of
professionals on how best practices in
their field
could be updated in response to
availability of remote sensing and gis
technologies
finally i hope this book will appear to
readers from non-government
non-governmental bodies and private
professionals who are involved
in making maps and master plans for
cultural heritage protection and
conservation
i hope that the techniques presented in
this book will help readers from this
group
develop more efficient and effective
processes as they
scramble to document and protected
thousands of immoral cultural heritage
artifacts
before these are consumed by expanding
cities
industries transportation networks and
other hallmarks of
rapid development
um i want to thank my institution where
i work
right now because this is the
institution i did my
phd as well so where we were able to
start
this area of research and also
development into a
um somewhat of a larger group uh
than it was before now and i thank you
one
and all for giving me this opportunity
and i look forward to interacting with
you
thank you
bring a book and unfortunately it was
very expensive
i therefore don't feel like telling the
cost of the book
uh but do get in touch with me i can
share with you which libraries it will
be available
and so on so my email is
m b r a j a
so do share with me i can help you with
where you can access the book
thank you
i would request the participants if they
have any further questions you can ask
mr
if there are any further questions you
can ask
there is one question about
differentiate differences in the rock
which is not necessarily
archaeology if anyone else wants to
answer uh
uh dr hinna maybe you can take up this
question
one of our participants wants to uh ask
that whether we can pick up the
differences in the
rock type or not
right i'll take up that question i think
it is more to do with
uh geological interpretation which can
easily be done
using the spectral characteristics that
we can see on the image
so whatever manifestation the
reflectance on the back scatter
gives on the image if we study that and
the spectral reflectance curve and
characteristics
uh based on which region of the spectrum
we are looking at the feature
or the rock type in we can easily make
such interpretations
and as i think dr rajali must also have
highlighted about crop marks
and soil marks and the anomalies that we
can see
then we can connect that to the
archaeological features
thank you dr hinna any further questions
there is a question about corona images
um so corona images are
about there were three stages these were
corona satellite series were actually
u.s satellites they were spy satellites
uh which were um operational between six
in sixties and seventies
and they were declassified in three
stages
uh this the class uh t class one two and
three
uh in the late 90s and early 2000s so
these are available quite a lot of them
are available open source
in usgs website where you have to go and
select for d
class data there are some which are paid
once
which are also not very expensive so you
can
access them through usgs usgs website
any other uh doubt if you have regarding
how geospatial technology can be used
for
archaeological um
studies especially for built monuments
there is one question on sar data sets
for band combination it says what is the
band combination for sar data sets for
sites in south india
for instance like khaledo and
mahabalipuram
i don't have myself applied far data
even in the book i only refer to it as
another technology
in i have myself not worked on our
datasets
again it is not so much about south
indian sites or specific sites
it is more on what is the surface
condition
moisture and so on um maybe somebody
else
can also um add to this answer
so a site like mahabalipuram is a
coastal science
site like halebiru is a site
in in karnataka so
it's uh it's sort of
dominantly cultivated site
so i since i have not myself applied
i can't really uh say what what is the
best
way to do it if somebody else wants to
answer that question
yeah thank you dr rajni i think uh dr
shashi has joined
the panel discussion so dr shashi there
was a question regarding sar data
which type of sar images can be used for
archaeological excavation
especially i think the participant wants
to know which particular wavelength
is required
uh actually if uh
to do
the mapping
and like
uh
uh
for all the users so one will have to
pay for the data set
but when the ni
when it will be launched so the data set
will be really available for the
thank you dr shashi i would request
if there are any further questions
that the resource persons can take up
if you have any further doubts
um can i there's one question on nalanda
specifically
yeah i think it must say you can answer
it best
okay so uh there is um one question
on uh if the fourth uh was recognized i
just missed
one second
is there further studies done at nalanda
to identify the fortification of
monastery
yes i know what uh this uh is a
reference to because there is
uh uh shuang sang who visited nalanda in
the
um seventh century uh mentions of
a wall that surrounded nalanda it had
only only one gate
and all the uh monks who wanted to go
and had to
you know go through an entrance exam and
that sort of thing
that reference is there and we have i
have myself tried
analyzing the data of different kinds to
identify this wall but
we haven't found any evidence of a wall
either in data or
also in any of the excavations that have
been reported in the last
150 years naland is a site that has been
interested for our
uh archaeologists have been interested
since 1860s
so so far there is no evidence of this
that has been found
there is one more question on what could
be the technical reason for sand at
colocado on its bank spread over a wide
area so there are a few
theories uh about it one is that uh
talakadu is in a very sort of uh sharp
hairpin bend of the river
uh it's a regular geological process
that the inner curve of a sharp vent
accumulates sand it is called point bar
and um also um a
geologist such as uh professor valdiya
has worked on the site and he has
suggested
because this particular bend faces
southwest
and the southwest monsoon winds blow
this exposed sand onto the site
and that's how it has spread
there is also another suggestion he has
made that the talakadu area itself
is active
with very mild tectonic
movements and therefore it has subsided
slightly and
the flood waters and behaves like a pool
collecting flood waters so all these are
suggestions the other one is there is a
a barrier a dam just upstream
and that dam has also caused the
discharge of the water reduce
reduce and therefore more of sand from
the river bed being exposed and blown
over to the site so these are the
uh different explanations that are
provided for the
accumulation of sand in that area so far
thank you dr rajni is there any further
question
which
[Music]
um there is one question
um i'm curious as to how you can apply
such methods on paleolithic sites which
have no monuments as such yes
this is an area that i haven't studied
very much as i i just wanted
to mention um when i started uh this
field we didn't know what it was
whether i started working in the street
we didn't know what kind of results we
would get so obviously
attracted towards sites that more things
are visible
such as uh historic sites where big
buildings were built
and probably their remains are still
there and so on so
regarding prehistoric and paleolithic i
haven't uh
worked very much but one that
is very promising is if not remote
sensing definitely gis
if the site is big and there are
materials collected from the site
if those can be locations can be taken
and a distribution
can be seen it is definitely something
that can
that lot of people in the world have
work work towards
but i don't have any examples to show
you from my work
um and also now since uh better and
better higher resolution images are
available
we can actually see um with high
resolution images smaller
burial or some features on with
some crop marks features which also
suggest so but
yeah it is it's an area that's worth
exploring and not
very much explored remote sensing
applications of paleolithic sites
uh maybe uh i would like to add a bit on
this
uh that with high resolution data now
coming up and
being used for civilian applications
then
uh the patterns in the uh
the stone patterns and all also can be
picked up by the satellite data and that
can be an indicator of
such sites
so that means we at uh
we in india i think have not worked much
on that
but anyhow we will definitely now since
the high resolution satellite data is
freely available
to all of us we would like to explore uh
into this domain also
and uh i would just like to uh tell all
our participants i think
all my panelists would agree with this
that
uh archaeology is a very site-specific
science so uh with geospatial technology
um so many tools and technologies are
available
now which site require what type of
device which site required what type of
technological studies
so that depends on the site itself
so we cannot generalize the entire the
methodology to
oils around the country or maybe around
the world also
so i would like i would request dr rajni
to
maybe elaborate more on this
yeah well in my book also there is a
chapter
which has a long preamble to say what
you were just saying that we don't have
one formulaic approach for every site uh
every site has variations uh natural and
cultural variations
they are diff they are located in
different natural settings
there could be planes mountains river
you know
river banks and that sort of thing there
could be
uh you know natural changes that has
happened since then
there are different cultural settings
that are they belong to different
dynasties different kinds of
architecture
and there are different cultural changes
that has happened since then i mean even
when the
site was active they would have been
renovations and things like that
so there are all these reasons why
it's very difficult to say that even two
sites are just
you know one same so every site is
unique in that way so
for every site the methodology will be
slightly more
will have to be modified so first one
thing is to learn
application of remote sensing gis and
being able to do but another thing
is to for er based on the demands that a
site puts or based on
the challenges that the sites put to
choose the right kind of technologies
and right kind of analysis
techniques for each site so in that way
there is no
set methods um it's not like a
you know sort of um a tool that you just
put
take that and it gives you answers it is
a science in itself
thank you dr rajni um are there any
further questions or uh
shall we wind up this session
i just want to answer one question uh
what is
it why is it important to save cultural
heritage through digital preservation
uh of course this is a long-standing
debate uh
you might wonder even i have wondered i
feel um
with remote sensing and gis and the kind
of
expertise i have developed i can
definitely see a lot more
heritage than we will have resources to
preserve i mean is it important to
preserve everything that is available or
identifiable i don't know but i think it
is
important enough to map everything and
it is probably in that way it
it will give us uh good reasons to see
uh
do we have 10 or examples of the same
kind of temple then maybe
only the you know the top two is we can
preserve the
rest we can let go kind of kind of
discussion can happen only when we have
that kind of
mapping and documentation but uh
this question is not necessarily only
for remote sensing gis kind of digital
technologies but it could also be for
other kind of digital technologies like
such as 3d scanning and
things like that i think um very
recently there was this uh
uh um occasion when uh a fire
uh had destroyed a church in europe
and because they had digitally preserved
the
uh the you know scan the structure they
were able to reconstruct
so in some cases maybe such uh
reconstruction won't be a possibility
but even to know such things
existed at a particular you know in the
past and they were
important you know for the heritage
uh in that for those purpose i think
digital preservation
is is important because not always we
can
preserve everything in physical space
yeah the church that you were talking i
think it was notre dame cathedral
in paris they have completely rebuilt
the entire structure
so thank you for giving us such a
insight into the area of
archaeology and how geospatial
technology
can be used for archaeological
exploration
and preservation of built monuments
thank you dr rajni thank you so much for
sharing your experiences and especially
about your recent book
with all our participants
yeah to the participants i would just
want to say
that thank you for joining this course
this was a unique course
first time uh we have conducted such
type of course at iaers
and as the course finishes today
in the e-class you can the option for
giving the feedback would become
activated
i would request all of you who have
participated in this course
to please give your feedback about the
course also
do write us in the feedback in the
comment section please write
how you felt about the course in
particular
what changes should do you suggest
could have been made uh i know that we
have
first of all announced this course for
two weeks but because of some
health issues with our senior resource
persons
at iars we have to compress this course
so maybe next time we will come up with
a longer duration course on the same
topic
but for organizing and for
making that course available i would
request all of you to provide your
feedback about this course
so thank you one and all do provide your
feedback to us
thank you all for joining in this
session and i thank all my resource
persons dr hina
pandey dr shashi kumar dr
mb rajni for sharing their
experiences with our participants i
especially thank dr
shefali agrawal she is not present with
us at this moment
because of some health reasons but she
has guided us a lot
towards organizing this course thank you
one and all
thank you
you
